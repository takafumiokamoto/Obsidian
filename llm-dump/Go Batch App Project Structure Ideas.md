### User

I am thinking about project structure for batch application in go.
In this project, the batch application needs three stub projects.
I would like to put each stub project in root directory.
I would like to avoid flat layout in this situation because it clutter root directory.
Do you have any idea of structuring this project?
I would also avoid using project structure that against best practices

**Framing the Architecture**

I'm currently breaking down the request to design a Go project structure. My focus is understanding the core task: a batch application with three "stub projects."  I'm trying to unpack what those "stub projects" represent and how they fit into the broader architecture. The constraint on that is my primary focus right now.


**Defining Project Boundaries**

I've clarified the intent behind the "stub projects." They seem to be distinct, runnable components. Currently, I'm navigating the user's conflicting constraints. They want the "stubs" at the root but also dislike cluttering.  I'm exploring potential solutions using Go best practices to balance these competing desires. I'm focusing on providing a clean structure that conceptually places the stubs at the top level without causing a messy root.


**Probing for Optimal Structure**

I'm now focusing on a structure that feels like it keeps the stubs at the top level while maintaining clarity. I'm leaning toward a root-level `cmd` directory to house each stub's `main` package, which aligns well with Go's standard practice. This strategy addresses the conflicting needs for perceived prominence and a clean project structure. Further refinement will consider how to best manage shared code or configurations used by these distinct "stub projects."


**Refining the Approach**

I'm now zeroing in on a root-level `cmd` directory to house each stub's `main` packages. This provides a clean separation for executables. I've begun drafting a structure that includes `internal` for shared project-specific code and `pkg` for potentially reusable components. The focus now is on defining the relationship between these three areas: root, `cmd`, `internal`, and `pkg`.


**Defining Dependencies**

I'm now focusing on how the "stub projects" will interact. They're likely dependent on shared code. Should they be independent binaries or importable libraries? Based on the task description, they'll likely share some utilities, but may have their own business logic. Therefore, I'm leaning toward organizing dependencies accordingly to fit the context.


**Structuring for Shared Code**

I'm now zeroing in on defining the structure for shared code within the project. The discussion has now moved to shared utilities and dependencies and the optimal way to manage them. My focus is on determining if the "stub projects" should be built as independent binaries or libraries that can be imported and utilized by others. I'm exploring the implications of both strategies to offer the best project structure in the provided context.


**Structuring Shared Logic**

I'm now determining how shared code will be structured and managed. I believe separating the project-specific shared code into the `/internal` directory provides a clean, well-organized structure. I am still evaluating the role of the `/pkg` directory and its utility for this particular design.


**Defining Dependencies**

I'm now exploring the implications of the three "stub projects" acting as individual run-able binaries vs. sharable libraries. My objective is a structure balancing the need for clear project boundaries while facilitating code reuse. I'm focusing on defining the best arrangement for shared dependencies and utilities within the context.


**Defining Interaction Strategies**

Now, I'm focusing on defining how the "stub projects" will interact. They'll likely need shared code. Should they be independent binaries or importable libraries? It appears they might share some utilities, but also have their own business logic, so I'm considering structuring their dependencies accordingly to best fit the requirements.



</details>

Of course! This is an excellent question, and it touches on a very common challenge in Go project layout: how to manage multiple related applications within a single repository without creating a mess.

You've correctly identified the tension: you want the "stub projects" (which are essentially separate applications) to be prominent, but you also want to avoid a flat, cluttered root directory.

The idiomatic and widely-accepted solution in the Go community is to use the **`/cmd` directory pattern**. This structure is a cornerstone of the [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) and perfectly addresses your requirements.

### The Recommended Structure: Using `/cmd`

Instead of placing each stub project directly in the root, you group them under a single `/cmd` directory. This keeps your root clean while creating a clear, conventional entry point for all runnable applications in your project.

Here is what that structure looks like:

```
/my-batch-project
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── README.md
├── Makefile         # Optional but highly recommended for automation
│
├── cmd/             # <-- Your "stub projects" (applications) live here
│   ├── data-importer/
│   │   └── main.go
│   ├── report-generator/
│   │   └── main.go
│   └── cleanup-task/
│       └── main.go
│
├── internal/        # <-- Shared private application code
│   ├── config/      # Configuration loading and management
│   │   └── config.go
│   ├── database/    # Database connection, queries, models
│   │   └── user_repo.go
│   ├── processing/  # Core business logic shared by your apps
│   │   └── process_data.go
│   └── client/      # Clients for external services (e.g., REST APIs)
│       └── some_api_client.go
│
├── pkg/             # Optional: Shared code that CAN be imported by other projects
│   └── my-public-library/
│       └── lib.go
│
└── configs/         # Application configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON)
    ├── development.yaml
    └── production.yaml
```

### Why This Structure Works So Well

1.  **Resolves Your Core Problem**: It avoids cluttering the root directory. The only top-level directories are conventional ones like `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg`, and `configs`. This immediately signals the project's structure to anyone familiar with Go.

2.  **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
    *   **`/cmd`**: Contains only the `main` package for each of your applications. The code here should be minimal, responsible for parsing flags/arguments, loading configuration, and starting the application by calling into your shared logic.
    *   **`/internal`**: This is where all your core business logic, database interactions, and other shared code lives. The Go toolchain enforces the privacy of this directory, meaning no other external project can import packages from your `internal` directory. This is perfect for code that is specific to *this* project.
    *   **`/pkg`**: This directory is for code you intend to be reusable and importable by *other* projects. For a self-contained batch application, you might not even need this directory. Starting with just `internal` is often best.

3.  **Scalability and Maintainability**: As your project grows, this structure scales beautifully. Need a fourth batch job? Just add a new subdirectory in `/cmd`. Need to add a new piece of shared logic? Add a new package in `/internal`. It keeps everything organized and prevents code duplication.

4.  **Follows Best Practices**: This is not an arbitrary structure; it's a well-established convention. Using it makes your project easier for other Go developers to understand and contribute to.

### How It Works in Practice

Let's look at an example. The `main.go` for your `data-importer` would be very simple.

**File: `cmd/data-importer/main.go`**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	// Import packages from your internal directory
	"my-batch-project/internal/config"
	"my-batch-project/internal/database"
	"my-batch-project/internal/processing"
)

func main() {
	// 1. Load configuration
	cfg, err := config.Load("configs/development.yaml")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to load configuration: %v", err)
	}

	// 2. Connect to the database
	db, err := database.NewConnection(cfg.Database)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to database: %v", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// 3. Execute the core logic
	fmt.Println("Starting data import...")
	repo := database.NewUserRepo(db)
	err = processing.ImportData(repo, cfg.DataSourceURL)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Data import failed: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Data import completed successfully.")
}
```

### Building and Running Your Stubs

With this structure, building and running each stub is straightforward and explicit.

```bash
# Run the data importer directly
go run ./cmd/data-importer

# Run the report generator
go run ./cmd/report-generator

# Build a specific application binary
# The output binary will be named 'data-importer'
go build -o ./bin/data-importer ./cmd/data-importer

# Build all applications
go build -o ./bin/data-importer ./cmd/data-importer
go build -o ./bin/report-generator ./cmd/report-generator
go build -o ./bin/cleanup-task ./cmd/cleanup-task
```

You can easily automate these build commands using a `Makefile` in your project root.

This `/cmd` pattern is the ideal solution for your use case. It directly addresses your desire to avoid a cluttered root while still organizing your applications logically and adhering to Go community best practices.

**Examining Project Structure**

I'm now fully deconstructing the user's request. My focus is on the core problem: structuring a batch application project. I've moved past the initial Go assumption. Now, I'm analyzing the need for a multi-language monorepo, taking into account the nuances. I'm aiming to provide an accurate project structure.


**Exploring Monorepo Options**

I've shifted focus to structuring a polyglot monorepo. I'm actively brainstorming to reconcile the desire for stub projects at the root with avoiding a cluttered layout. The previous "flat" approach is now rejected. This is a classic monorepo trade-off I'm trying to solve. I'm focusing on balancing user preferences and industry-standard practices.


**Defining Best-Fit Structure**

I'm now deep-diving into the "grouped by function" strategy for the monorepo. This approach, widely used by industry giants, seems ideal. I'm focusing on adapting this model to the user's specific "stub project" scenario. This approach, while most complex, offers the best scalability and clarity. I'm exploring variations for accommodating those "root" stubs without being too cluttered.


**Reconciling Root Stubs**

I'm now fully committed to the "grouped by function" strategy, which aligns with industry best practices. My challenge is to adapt this powerful, scalable model to accommodate the user's wish for "root" stubs without sacrificing clarity. I am actively brainstorming ways to introduce stub project "links" at the root level without reverting to a cluttered layout. The goal is a clean, scalable monorepo.


**Defining Root-Level Access**

I've been meticulously studying the "grouped by function" strategy, which I've deemed the best fit. My focus now is the user's need for "stub" projects to have root-level accessibility. I'm exploring symbolic links or aliases to allow convenient access to these essential stubs at the root level, preserving the structure's clarity and scalability. This refinement directly addresses the central design conflict I identified. I believe this will be the best structure.


**Defining Root Access Refinement**

Now, I'm focusing on the "grouped by function" strategy for the monorepo and how to accommodate the user's need for direct root access to stub projects. I've been exploring a few ways to "link" them to the root while maintaining structure and scalability. Using aliases or symbolic links seems like the most promising approach. I aim to maintain best practices while addressing the user's specific request.


**Finalizing Monorepo Structure**

I've carefully considered how to elegantly integrate those stub projects into the "grouped by function" approach. My current plan is to leverage symbolic links or aliases from the project root to each stub within the `/apps` directory. This preserves the desired structure, ensures clean root access, and maintains scalability. I believe this will provide the best of both worlds!



</details>

Ah, that is a crucial and clarifying detail! Thank you for correcting me.

This changes the problem from a "Go project layout" question to a **"polyglot monorepo"** question, where a Go application needs to orchestrate or interact with other applications written in different languages.

The core principle remains the same: keep the root directory clean and organized. The Go-specific `/cmd` directory is no longer the right fit for the non-Go stubs. Instead, a more general and language-agnostic pattern is needed.

The best practice for this scenario is to use a top-level directory like `/apps` or `/services` to house all the independent, runnable applications, including your main Go app and the stubs.

### The Recommended Polyglot Monorepo Structure

Here is a robust and clean structure for your project:

```
/my-batch-project
├── go.mod             # For the Go orchestrator app
├── go.sum
├── README.md
├── Makefile           # Essential for managing a multi-language project
├── docker-compose.yml # Optional, for running services together
│
├── apps/              # <-- All runnable applications live here
│   ├── go-orchestrator/   # Your main Go application
│   │   ├── cmd/
│   │   │   └── main/
│   │   │       └── main.go
│   │   ├── internal/
│   │   │   └── executor/
│   │   │       └── exec.go
│   │   └── go.mod         # Optional: can be a sub-module
│   │
│   ├── python-data-validator/ # Stub 1 (e.g., Python)
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   ├── requirements.txt
│   │   └── Dockerfile
│   │
│   ├── node-notifier/         # Stub 2 (e.g., Node.js)
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── Dockerfile
│   │
│   └── shell-cleanup/         # Stub 3 (e.g., Shell script)
│       └── cleanup.sh
│
└── configs/           # Shared configuration files
    ├── orchestrator.yaml
    └── validator.json
```

### Why This Structure is a Best Practice

1.  **Extremely Clean Root**: The root directory is minimal. It contains project-wide metadata (`README`, `Makefile`) and a single, clearly named `apps` directory. This immediately tells a developer where to find the code.

2.  **Logical Grouping**: It groups components by their role (**application**) rather than by their technology. This is more intuitive. `go-orchestrator` and `python-data-validator` are peers, both being applications within the larger project.

3.  **Self-Contained Apps**: Each subdirectory under `/apps` is a self-contained project. The `python-data-validator` has its own `requirements.txt`, the `node-notifier` has its `package.json`. This prevents dependency conflicts between the different parts of your system.

4.  **Scalability**: This pattern scales effortlessly. Need to add a fourth stub written in Rust? Just add `/apps/rust-report-generator/` and you're done. The overall structure remains clean.

5.  **Tooling-Friendly**: A top-level `Makefile` or `justfile` becomes incredibly powerful here. You can define simple commands to manage the whole project:
    *   `make build`: Builds the Go app, runs `npm install` for the Node app, etc.
    *   `make test`: Runs tests for all applications.
    *   `make run-batch`: Executes the main Go orchestrator.

### How the Go App Calls the Stubs

Your Go application now acts as an **orchestrator**. It will use the `os/exec` package to call the other stub applications. The logic for this would live inside your Go app, for example, in `/apps/go-orchestrator/internal/executor/`.

Here is a simplified example of what that Go code might look like:

**File: `apps/go-orchestrator/internal/executor/exec.go`**

```go
package executor

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os/exec"
	"path/filepath"
)

// RunPythonValidator executes the Python stub project.
// appRoot is the absolute path to the root of the monorepo.
func RunPythonValidator(appRoot, dataFile string) error {
	// Construct the path to the python script relative to the project root
	scriptDir := filepath.Join(appRoot, "apps", "python-data-validator")
	scriptPath := filepath.Join(scriptDir, "main.py")

	log.Printf("Executing Python validator: %s", scriptPath)

	// The command to run is 'python' with the script path as an argument
	cmd := exec.Command("python3", scriptPath, "--file", dataFile)

	// Set the working directory for the script, so it can find its own files
	cmd.Dir = scriptDir

	// Capture combined stdout and stderr
	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		// If the command fails, log the error and the output from the script
		log.Printf("Python script failed. Output:\n%s", string(output))
		return fmt.Errorf("python validator failed: %w", err)
	}

	log.Printf("Python script finished. Output:\n%s", string(output))
	return nil
}

// RunShellCleanup executes the shell script stub.
func RunShellCleanup(appRoot string) error {
	scriptPath := filepath.Join(appRoot, "apps", "shell-cleanup", "cleanup.sh")
	log.Printf("Executing shell cleanup script: %s", scriptPath)

	cmd := exec.Command("/bin/bash", scriptPath)

	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Shell script failed. Output:\n%s", string(output))
		return fmt.Errorf("shell cleanup failed: %w", err)
	}

	log.Printf("Shell script finished successfully.")
	return nil
}
```

### Summary

For a multi-language project, **avoid placing language-specific projects in the root**. Instead, adopt the **`/apps` directory pattern**.

This gives you:
*   A clean, professional root directory.
*   Clear separation between independent applications.
*   A scalable structure that's easy to understand and maintain.
*   A perfect foundation for automation with tools like `make` or Docker.

This approach directly solves your problem and is the standard for modern monorepo development.

**Understanding the Core Issue**

I'm starting to grasp the essence of the user's question, which is whether a `go.mod` file *must* reside in the root directory. This stems from a larger, perhaps polyglot, monorepo context. I'm focusing on dissecting the implied constraints and their impact.


**Analyzing Project Structures**

I've further refined my understanding of the user's inquiry, focusing on the implications of a Go module's placement. The discussion now includes clarifying the trade-offs between a single module root and independent modules for individual applications. I'm exploring the specific benefits and drawbacks each architecture brings to polyglot monorepos, especially considering the Go orchestrator and non-Go stubs.


**Refining Answer Structure**

I've clarified the structure of my response. It begins with a direct answer and explores two primary module options: single root module and independent modules per application. Each option includes file structure examples and a clear comparison of pros and cons. I'm focusing on concisely presenting Go Workspaces as a powerful solution.


**Exploring Alternative Architectures**

I'm now diving deep into the pros and cons of individual modules and their impact on build workflows. The challenge lies in providing clear examples of file structures and addressing the complexity that can arise. I'm focusing on providing practical examples and comparing the trade-offs. I'm confident that the answer is becoming very clear.


**Expanding the Solution Space**

I'm now exploring the Go Workspaces solution in greater detail, focusing on its role in addressing tooling complexity. I'll describe how `go.work` enables building and testing from the root directory while maintaining encapsulation. The practical considerations and structure examples will be key for demonstrating the optimal approach. I'll summarize it as a table.

To highlight these exceptions, I'll showcase the strengths and weaknesses of each option in the table. This table will clarify the decision-making process by simplifying the comparison of different approaches and will conclude my response.


**Revising and Summarizing**

I'm now iterating on the response, focusing on precise wording and clarifying the nuanced recommendations. I'm ensuring the file structure examples are easily understood and accurately reflect each option. The table is being refined to provide quick and clear comparisons. I'm striving to communicate the complexity of monorepo management.

I have to make sure to clearly address the original premise: can a `go.mod` not be at the root? The solution needs to come across well, as well as the summary.


</details>

Excellent question. This gets to the heart of how you define your project's boundaries.

No, it is **not necessary** to have a `go.mod` file in the root directory. In fact, for the polyglot monorepo structure we just discussed, it's often cleaner *not* to have it in the root.

You have two primary choices, with a third, modern option that provides the best of both worlds.

---

### Option 1: Single Go Module at the Root

In this model, the entire monorepo is treated as one large Go module, even though most of it isn't Go code.

```
/my-batch-project
├── go.mod             # <-- The single Go module for the whole project
├── go.sum
├── Makefile
│
└── apps/
    ├── go-orchestrator/   # Just contains Go source files
    │   ├── cmd/main/main.go
    │   └── internal/executor/exec.go
    │
    ├── python-data-validator/
    └── node-notifier/
```

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Simple Tooling:** From the root directory, you can run `go build ./apps/go-orchestrator/cmd/main` without any extra configuration.
    *   **Simple Imports:** The import path is clear: `my-batch-project/apps/go-orchestrator/internal/executor`.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Misleading Structure:** The `go.mod` file in the root implies the entire project is a Go project, which is not true. It "pollutes" the root with concerns that are specific to only one of the applications.
    *   **Poor Encapsulation:** The Go application is not self-contained. You can't easily move the `go-orchestrator` directory to another project because its module definition lives outside of it.
    *   **Dependency Bloat:** If you were to add a *second* Go application, all their dependencies would be mixed together in the single root `go.mod` file, which can become messy.

---

### Option 2: Independent Go Module per Application

In this model, only the Go application itself is a Go module. This is a much cleaner, more encapsulated approach.

```
/my-batch-project
├── Makefile           # No go.mod or go.sum in the root
│
└── apps/
    ├── go-orchestrator/   # This directory is a self-contained Go project
    │   ├── go.mod         # <-- Module file lives here
    │   ├── go.sum
    │   ├── cmd/main/main.go
    │   └── internal/executor/exec.go
    │
    ├── python-data-validator/
    └── node-notifier/
```

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Excellent Encapsulation:** The `go-orchestrator` is a complete, portable Go project. All its dependencies and definitions are contained within its own directory. This is very clean.
    *   **Clarity:** It's perfectly clear that the Go module concerns belong *only* to the orchestrator application. The root directory remains language-agnostic.
    *   **Scalability:** If you add another Go app, it will have its own `go.mod`, keeping dependencies completely separate.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Tooling Friction (The Old Problem):** Before Go 1.18, working from the root directory was awkward. You would have to `cd apps/go-orchestrator` before running `go build` or `go test`. Your IDE might also get confused about the project structure.

---

### The Modern Solution: Go Workspaces (`go.work`)

Go 1.18 introduced **workspaces** to solve this exact problem. It gives you the clean encapsulation of Option 2 with the tooling convenience of Option 1. **This is the recommended approach.**

You place a `go.work` file in the root that tells the Go toolchain which directories contain Go modules.

```
/my-batch-project
├── go.work            # <-- Tells Go where to find modules
├── Makefile
│
└── apps/
    ├── go-orchestrator/   # Still a self-contained Go project
    │   ├── go.mod         # <-- Owns its dependencies
    │   ├── go.sum
    │   ├── cmd/main/main.go
    │   └── internal/executor/exec.go
    │
    ├── python-data-validator/
    └── node-notifier/
```

The content of `go.work` would be very simple:

**File: `go.work`**

```
go 1.22 // Or your Go version

use (
    ./apps/go-orchestrator
)
```

*   **Pros (Best of Both Worlds):**
    *   **Keeps the clean encapsulation** of Option 2. Each Go app is self-contained.
    *   **Provides the tooling convenience** of Option 1. You can run `go build`, `go test`, and other commands from the root directory, and the Go toolchain will automatically understand the structure thanks to `go.work`.
    *   This is the **idiomatic, modern Go solution** for monorepos containing one or more Go modules.

### Recommendation

**Use the Go Workspace (`go.work`) approach.**

It is the superior choice for your use case. It keeps your Go application neatly encapsulated within the `/apps` directory while providing a seamless development experience from the project root. It's the cleanest, most maintainable, and most idiomatic solution.

**Examining Makefile Concepts**

I'm now diving into the user's focus on `Makefile` construction and build processes within a polyglot monorepo, inspired by their appreciation of `go.work`. The primary goal is to detail a `Makefile` that harmonizes with a multi-language setup, taking cues from the `go.work` approach.


**Developing Makefile Targets**

I've outlined crucial tasks for a monorepo `Makefile`: building, running, testing, and cleaning. Specifically, I'm focusing on the commands for building the Go application, Python application (via dependency installation), and Node.js application (including potential build steps). Furthermore, I'm defining how to run tests for each component and establishing cleaning procedures for build artifacts, ensuring an efficient and tidy build environment.


**Structuring Makefile Explanations**

I'm structuring the explanation by introducing a complete `Makefile` first, followed by a section-by-section breakdown. The `Makefile` will be commented for clarity. I'll highlight `PHONY` targets for efficient builds and explain the variables to promote configurability. My aim is a clear, concise guide to create a versatile monorepo build setup.


**Developing the `Makefile` Outline**

I'm now structuring the explanation around specific sections. I'll begin with an overview, followed by the complete `Makefile`, broken down into sections: variables, build, run, test, clean, and formatting. The guide will provide examples and emphasize `PHONY` targets for clarity, along with the rationale behind the chosen variables.


**Developing the Makefile**

I'm now structuring the explanation based on the `Makefile` itself, including comments and variables for clarity and customization. A "Why this Makefile is effective" section is planned. I'm building it iteratively, starting with variables, a default `help` target, build targets (Go, Python, Node), install dependencies (Python, Node), run target, and so forth. I'm focusing on well-commented code, variable configuration, and a practical guide.


**Expanding the `Makefile` Targets**

Now, I'm integrating specific commands for Go, Python, and Node.js. For the Go app, it's about the build command and testing with `go test ./...`. For Python, this is installing dependencies via `pip` and running tests with `pytest`. Similarly, it involves installing dependencies and running tests for Node.js using `npm`. I'm meticulously detailing each part of the process.


**Crafting the `Makefile`**

I'm now detailing the `Makefile` step-by-step, including comprehensive comments and variables for clear understanding and effortless customization, with a focus on highlighting the rationale behind the design choices and the "Why this Makefile is effective" section. This process is iterative, focusing on variables, a helpful `help` target, build targets (Go, Python, Node), dependency installation, and the run target. I will also incorporate clear annotations, provide variable configurations, and practical guide. I'm aiming for a straightforward and effective guide for a smooth user experience.

Excellent! A `Makefile` is the perfect tool to orchestrate a polyglot monorepo. It acts as a centralized, simple entry point for all common development tasks, abstracting away the specific commands for each language.

With the `go.work` setup, your `Makefile` can live in the project root and execute commands for all your applications seamlessly.

Let's use our previous project structure:

```
/my-batch-project
├── go.work
├── Makefile           # <-- We will create this file
│
└── apps/
    ├── go-orchestrator/
    │   ├── go.mod
    │   ├── cmd/main/main.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── python-data-validator/
    │   ├── main.py
    │   └── requirements.txt
    └── node-notifier/
        ├── index.js
        └── package.json
```

### The Makefile

Here is a comprehensive `Makefile` you can place in your project root. It's commented to explain each part.

```makefile
# Makefile for the Polyglot Batch Project

# --- Variables ---
# Use these to easily configure paths and names.
BINARY_DIR := ./bin
BINARY_NAME := go-orchestrator
GO_APP_DIR := ./apps/go-orchestrator
PYTHON_APP_DIR := ./apps/python-data-validator
NODE_APP_DIR := ./apps/node-notifier

# --- Tool Commands ---
# Allows for easily swapping out command names (e.g., python3 vs python)
GOCMD := go
PYTHONCMD := python3
NPMCMD := npm

# --- Phony Targets ---
# Declares targets that are not files. This prevents conflicts with files of the
# same name and improves performance.
.PHONY: all build build-go run test test-go test-py test-node clean install install-py install-node help

# --- Default Goal ---
# The command that runs when you just type `make`.
.DEFAULT_GOAL := help

# --- Main Targets ---

all: install build ## Install dependencies and build all applications

build: build-go ## Build all runnable applications
	@echo "Build complete."

build-go: ## Build the Go orchestrator application
	@echo "Building Go application..."
	@mkdir -p $(BINARY_DIR)
	$(GOCMD) build -o $(BINARY_DIR)/$(BINARY_NAME) $(GO_APP_DIR)/cmd/main/main.go

run: ## Run the Go orchestrator without building a binary
	@echo "Running Go application..."
	$(GOCMD) run $(GO_APP_DIR)/cmd/main/main.go

install: install-py install-node ## Install all language-specific dependencies
	@echo "All dependencies installed."

install-py: ## Install Python dependencies using pip
	@echo "Installing Python dependencies..."
	$(PYTHONCMD) -m pip install -r $(PYTHON_APP_DIR)/requirements.txt

install-node: ## Install Node.js dependencies using npm
	@echo "Installing Node.js dependencies..."
	cd $(NODE_APP_DIR) && $(NPMCMD) install

test: test-go test-py test-node ## Run tests for all applications
	@echo "All tests passed."

test-go: ## Run Go tests
	@echo "Testing Go application..."
	# The `./...` syntax works from the root because of go.work
	$(GOCMD) test -v ./...

test-py: ## Run Python tests (assumes pytest)
	@echo "Testing Python application..."
	cd $(PYTHON_APP_DIR) && $(PYTHONCMD) -m pytest

test-node: ## Run Node.js tests
	@echo "Testing Node.js application..."
	cd $(NODE_APP_DIR) && $(NPMCMD) test

clean: ## Remove build artifacts and installed dependencies
	@echo "Cleaning up project..."
	@rm -rf $(BINARY_DIR)
	@cd $(NODE_APP_DIR) && rm -rf node_modules
	@find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
	@find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete
	@echo "Cleanup complete."

help: ## Display this help screen
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "\033[36m%-20s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'

```

### How to Use It (The `make` Commands)

From your project's root directory, you can now run simple, high-level commands:

*   **`make` or `make help`**
    Displays the helpful list of available commands.

*   **`make install`**
    Runs `pip install` for your Python app and `npm install` for your Node.js app.

*   **`make build`**
    Compiles your Go application and places the binary in the `./bin/` directory.

*   **`make all`**
    A convenient shortcut to run `make install` and then `make build`. This is great for initial setup.

*   **`make run`**
    Quickly executes your main Go application using `go run`. This is useful for development as it doesn't require a separate build step.

*   **`make test`**
    Runs the test suites for Go, Python, and Node.js, one after the other.

*   **`make clean`**
    Deletes the `./bin` directory, `node_modules`, and Python cache files to give you a clean slate.

### The Raw Build Commands (What `make` is doing)

You also asked what the build commands look like. The `Makefile` simply wraps these raw shell commands.

**To build the Go application:**

The `go.work` file is key here. Because it exists in the root, you can run the `go build` command from the root, and it will correctly find the module inside `/apps/go-orchestrator`.

```bash
# Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ./bin

# Build the Go program. The output binary will be named 'go-orchestrator'
# and placed in the './bin' directory.
go build -o ./bin/go-orchestrator ./apps/go-orchestrator/cmd/main/main.go
```

**To install dependencies for the stubs:**

These commands are language-specific and are run from the root.

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r ./apps/python-data-validator/requirements.txt

# Install Node.js dependencies
# We cd into the directory so npm creates node_modules in the right place
cd ./apps/node-notifier && npm install
```

The `Makefile` elegantly combines all these commands under simple, memorable names, creating a consistent interface for anyone working on the project.
