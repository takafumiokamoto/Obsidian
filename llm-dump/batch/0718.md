### Setting a Global Custom Endpoint in AWS SDK for Go v2

To configure a custom endpoint, such as `localhost:4566` for use with LocalStack, across all AWS service clients globally in the AWS SDK for Go v2, you can leverage a custom endpoint resolver. This is achieved by using the `config.WithEndpointResolverWithOptions` function when loading your AWS configuration. This approach ensures that any service client created using this configuration will automatically point to your specified endpoint.

The recommended method involves creating an `aws.EndpointResolverWithOptionsFunc`. This function allows you to define custom logic for resolving service endpoints. By setting the `URL` field in the returned `aws.Endpoint` struct, you can direct all AWS service requests to your local endpoint.

Here is a step-by-step guide and a code example:

#### 1. Implement a Custom Endpoint Resolver

First, you need to create a function that conforms to the `aws.EndpointResolverWithOptionsFunc` type. This function takes the service ID, region, and other options as input and should return an `aws.Endpoint` struct with the custom URL.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
)

func main() {
	// Define your custom endpoint URL
	customEndpointURL := "http://localhost:4566"

	// Create a custom endpoint resolver
	customResolver := aws.EndpointResolverWithOptionsFunc(func(service, region string, options ...interface{}) (aws.Endpoint, error) {
		return aws.Endpoint{
			URL:           customEndpointURL,
			SigningRegion: region,
			PartitionID:   "aws",
		}, nil
	})

	// Load the default AWS configuration, with the custom endpoint resolver
	cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(),
		config.WithRegion("us-east-1"), // Specify a default region
		config.WithEndpointResolverWithOptions(customResolver),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to load configuration, %v", err)
	}

	// Create a new S3 client using the modified configuration
	// This client will now use http://localhost:4566 for all its requests
	s3Client := s3.NewFromConfig(cfg, func(o *s3.Options) {
        // For S3, it's often necessary to use path-style addressing with local endpoints
		o.UsePathStyle = true
	})

	// Now you can use the s3Client to interact with your local S3-compatible service
	// For example, list buckets
	// ... (your S3 operations)
}
```

#### 2. Load Configuration with the Custom Resolver

In the example above, `config.LoadDefaultConfig` is used to load the default configuration chain (environment variables, shared config files). We then augment this configuration with our custom endpoint resolver using `config.WithEndpointResolverWithOptions(customResolver)`.

Any service client created from this `cfg` object will now use the logic defined in `customResolver` to determine the endpoint.

#### Important Considerations:

*   **Path-Style Addressing for S3:** When using a custom endpoint for Amazon S3, especially with tools like LocalStack, you often need to enable path-style addressing. This is done by setting `o.UsePathStyle = true` in the service-specific options when creating the S3 client, as shown in the example.
*   **Region:** Even though you are using a local endpoint, it's good practice to specify an AWS region in your configuration. Some services may still require a region to be present.
*   **Endpoint Resolution Versions:** The AWS SDK for Go v2 has evolved its endpoint resolution mechanism. The approach described here uses the latest and recommended `EndpointResolverWithOptions`.
