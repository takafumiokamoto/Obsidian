### User

Help me build a batch application with best practices in Go.
In my application, I use the 'Dependency Injection' pattern.
I also want to avoid 'prop drilling'.
To achieve this, I have a struct named Dependency which contains all global dependencies, such as a logger and configuration.
I thought embracing this design pattern would be great. However, my code became more verbose. For example, I have to specify <mystruct>.<dependency>.logger to access the logger every time.
And I have to include the dependency struct in every struct I create. At this point, I want to make these dependencies globally available since all my structs need them. I am concerned about whether this is against best practice.

Thank you for reaching out! I'm T3 Chat, here to help you with your Go batch application. I appreciate you sharing the details of your setup—it sounds like you're thoughtfully applying dependency injection (DI) to keep things modular and avoid prop drilling (passing props/dependencies deep through layers of structs or functions). That's a solid foundation, especially in Go, where explicitness and testability are key principles. However, I totally get the frustration with verbosity; it's a common trade-off when balancing clean architecture with practical coding.

Let's break this down step by step. I'll explain why your current approach is good, address your concerns about globals, and suggest best-practice ways to reduce verbosity without sacrificing maintainability. We'll aim for idiomatic Go code that's testable, modular, and efficient for a batch application (e.g., something that runs periodically, processes data, and exits).

### 1. Why Your DI Approach is a Good Starting Point
- **Dependency Injection in Go**: Go doesn't have built-in DI like some languages (e.g., Java's Spring), so manually injecting dependencies via structs or constructors is a common and recommended pattern. Your `Dependency` struct (holding things like a logger and config) is a great way to bundle shared resources explicitly. This avoids hidden globals, makes dependencies easy to mock in tests, and promotes loose coupling.
- **Avoiding Prop Drilling**: By embedding or passing the `Dependency` struct into other structs, you're preventing the need to pass individual deps (e.g., logger) through every function call. This is better than globals for larger apps.
- **Batch App Context**: In a batch job (e.g., ETL process, data migration), you often have a single entry point (`main`), short-lived execution, and shared resources like logging/config. DI shines here for wiring things up once at startup.

However, the verbosity you're seeing (e.g., `mystruct.dependency.logger`) is real—it's the cost of explicitness. Making everything global might feel tempting for simplicity, but let's discuss if that's wise.

### 2. Are Globals Against Best Practices?
Short answer: **Yes, in most cases, globals are discouraged in Go**, but there are nuanced exceptions. Here's why:

- **Pros of Globals**:
  - Reduces verbosity: Access `logger.Info(...)` from anywhere without drilling.
  - Simpler for small apps or scripts where testability isn't a big concern.

- **Cons and Why It's Often Bad Practice**:
  - **Hidden Dependencies**: Globals make it hard to see what a function/struct relies on, violating Go's emphasis on clarity (e.g., "explicit is better than implicit").
  - **Testing Challenges**: You can't easily mock or swap globals in unit tests without hacks (e.g., patching package-level vars), leading to brittle tests.
  - **Concurrency Issues**: In a batch app with goroutines, globals can cause races if not protected (e.g., with mutexes).
  - **Modularity and Reusability**: Globals tie your code to a specific environment, making it harder to reuse components in other projects or microservices.
  - **Go Community Guidance**: The Go proverb "A little copying is better than a little dependency" favors explicit passing over shared state. Tools like `golangci-lint` even flag excessive globals.

That said, **limited use of package-level variables** (not true globals, but exported vars in a package) can be acceptable for *immutable* shared state in simple apps, like a config loaded at startup. For example, the standard library uses this sparingly (e.g., `os.Stdout`). But for mutable things like loggers, it's risky.

**My Recommendation**: Avoid full globals. Instead, optimize your DI to minimize verbosity while keeping explicitness. If your app is tiny (e.g., a single-file script), a package-level var might be fine—but for anything scalable, stick with DI.

### 3. Best Practices to Reduce Verbosity with DI
Let's refine your approach. I'll suggest patterns that keep deps injectable but make access feel less cumbersome. We'll use constructor functions (a Go idiom for DI) and embedding to streamline things.

#### Step 1: Define Your Dependency Struct
Keep it simple and embeddable. Make it a struct that can be shared across your app.

```go
// package deps (or wherever you centralize this)

// Dependency holds shared app-wide dependencies.
// It's designed to be embedded or passed around easily.
type Dependency struct {
    Logger LoggerInterface // Use an interface for mockability
    Config *Config         // Assume this is your config struct
    // Add more as needed, e.g., DB client, HTTP client
}

// NewDependency creates a new Dependency instance.
// This is your "wiring" function—call it once in main.
func NewDependency() *Dependency {
    // Load config, init logger, etc.
    config := loadConfig() // Your config loading logic
    logger := initLogger(config) // e.g., using zap or logrus

    return &Dependency{
        Logger: logger,
        Config: config,
    }
}
```

- **Why this?** Centralizes initialization. Use interfaces (e *g., `LoggerInterface`) for everything to enable mocking in tests.

#### Step 2: Inject Dependencies Without Prop Drilling
Instead of including `Dependency` in *every* struct, use these techniques:

- **Embedding for Shorter Access**: Embed `Dependency` in structs that need it. This lets you access deps directly (e.g., `mystruct.Logger`) without the extra dot.

```go
// Example struct for a batch processor
type BatchProcessor struct {
    *Dependency // Embed! Now Logger and Config are "inherited"
    // Other fields, e.g., someState int
}

// NewBatchProcessor is a constructor that injects deps.
func NewBatchProcessor(dep *Dependency) *BatchProcessor {
    return &BatchProcessor{Dependency: dep}
}

// Now usage is less verbose
func (bp *BatchProcessor) Process() {
    bp.Logger.Info("Starting batch process") // No bp.dependency.Logger!
    // Use bp.Config.SomeValue
}
```

- **Constructor Functions Everywhere**: Always create structs via `NewXxx(dep *Dependency)` functions. This enforces DI and allows easy injection.

- **Context for Functions (If Not Using Structs)**: For standalone functions, pass a Go `context.Context` with deps attached (using `context.WithValue`). But prefer structs for batch logic to group related methods.

- **Functional Options Pattern**: For flexibility, use options to customize deps during construction (e.g., overriding logger for tests).

#### Step 3: Wiring in `main` for a Batch App
In your `main` package, wire everything once and run the batch.

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "yourapp/deps" // Assuming your Dependency is here
    // Other imports
)

func main() {
    dep := deps.NewDependency()

    // Create your main components with injected deps
    processor := NewBatchProcessor(dep)
    // Other services, e.g., dataFetcher := NewDataFetcher(dep)

    // Run the batch
    if err := processor.Process(); err != nil {
        dep.Logger.Error("Batch failed", err)
        // Handle exit, e.g., os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

- **Why this works for batch apps**: Short lifecycle means you init deps once, inject them, and done. No need for long-running servers or complex DI frameworks unless your app grows.

#### Step 4: Testing Best Practices
To make this testable:
- Use interfaces for all deps (e.g., `LoggerInterface` with methods like `Info(string)`).
- In tests, create mock deps and inject them via constructors.

```go
// batch_processor_test.go
func TestBatchProcessor_Process(t *testing.T) {
    mockLogger := &MockLogger{} // Your mock implementation
    dep := &deps.Dependency{Logger: mockLogger}
    bp := NewBatchProcessor(dep)

    bp.Process()
    // Assert mockLogger.Info was called
}
```

### 4. Advanced Options If Your App Scales
If verbosity persists or your app gets larger:
- **DI Frameworks**: Use `google/wire` for compile-time DI or `uber-go/fx` for runtime DI. These automate wiring and reduce boilerplate.
  - Example with Wire: Define providers and let it generate the wiring code.
- **Singleton-Like Package Vars (Cautious Global Alternative)**: If you *really* want global access, export a package var but set it via an init function or setter. This is "global-ish" but injectable.
  ```go
  // deps package
  var GlobalDeps *Dependency

  func InitGlobalDeps() {
      GlobalDeps = NewDependency()
  }
  ```
  Then call `deps.InitGlobalDeps()` in `main`. Access via `deps.GlobalDeps.Logger`. But this reintroduces some global cons—use sparingly.

### Final Thoughts
Your instinct to avoid globals is spot-on; it aligns with Go best practices for maintainable code. By embedding the `Dependency` struct and using constructors, you can cut down on verbosity significantly (e.g., from `mystruct.dependency.logger` to `mystruct.Logger`) without losing DI benefits. This setup should work great for a batch app—explicit, testable, and not overly complex.

If you share more details (e.g., code snippets, what your logger/config look like, or the scale of your app), I can refine this further or provide a full example repo structure. What specific part of the batch process are you building (e.g., data processing, API calls)? Let's iterate on this! 😊

I am using Zap for logging.
Zap doesn’t offer interfaces.
Because of this, I have to create interface that just wrapping Zap’s function signature.

Thank you for the additional details! Using Zap (from Uber's go.uber.org/zap) is an excellent choice for logging in Go—it's fast, structured, and highly configurable, which is perfect for a batch application where performance and log clarity matter. You're absolutely right that Zap doesn't provide built-in interfaces; it's designed as a concrete implementation for efficiency. Creating a thin wrapper interface around it is a standard and recommended best practice in Go for dependency injection (DI) and testing. This allows you to decouple your code from the specific logger implementation, making it easier to mock in unit tests (e.g., with libraries like testify/mock) or swap loggers later if needed.

I'll walk you through this step by step, including why it's beneficial, how to design a minimal interface, and how to integrate it with your `Dependency` struct from our previous discussion. We'll keep things idiomatic, testable, and as non-verbose as possible. If you're using a linter like golangci-lint, this approach should pass without issues.

### Why Wrap Zap in an Interface?
- **Testability**: In tests, you can inject a mock logger to verify logs without writing to real outputs (e.g., stdout or files).
- **Decoupling**: Your business logic depends on an interface (e.g., `Logger`), not `*zap.Logger`. This follows the Dependency Inversion Principle and makes your code more flexible.
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Only wrap the methods you actually use (e.g., Info, Error). Don't overdo it—Go favors simplicity.
- **No Performance Hit**: The wrapper is just a thin layer; Zap's speed remains intact.

Common pitfalls to avoid: Don't make the interface too broad (e.g., mirroring all of Zap's API). Start small and expand as needed.

### Step 1: Define a Logger Interface
Create a simple interface in a central package (e.g., your `deps` package). Focus on the core methods your app uses. For a batch app, things like Info, Warn, Error, and Sync (for flushing) are often sufficient.

```go
// package deps (or a dedicated logging package)

// Logger defines a minimal interface for logging.
// It wraps common Zap methods; add more as your app needs them.
type Logger interface {
    Info(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Warn(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Error(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Sync() error // For flushing logs before app exit
    // Add others if needed, e.g., Debug, With(zap.Field) for context
}
```

- **Why these methods?** They match Zap's signatures closely, making the wrapper easy to implement. Use `...zap.Field` for structured logging.
- **Customization Tip**: If you need leveled logging with context (e.g., per-request IDs in a batch job), add a `With(fields ...zap.Field) Logger` method to return a new logger instance.

### Step 2: Implement the Wrapper for Zap
Create a struct that embeds `*zap.Logger` and implements your `Logger` interface. This keeps the implementation concise—most methods are just pass-throughs.

```go
// package deps

import "go.uber.org/zap"

// zapLogger is a concrete implementation of Logger using Zap.
// It embeds *zap.Logger for direct access to its methods.
type zapLogger struct {
    *zap.Logger
}

// NewZapLogger creates a new Logger instance backed by Zap.
// Configure it based on your needs (e.g., production vs. development).
func NewZapLogger(config *Config) Logger { // Assuming Config has logging settings
    var z *zap.Logger
    if config.Env == "production" {
        z = zap.NewProduction()
    } else {
        z = zap.NewDevelopment()
    }
    // Add custom config, e.g., z = z.WithOptions(zap.AddCaller())
    return &zapLogger{Logger: z}
}

// Implement the interface methods (just wrappers)
func (l *zapLogger) Info(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) {
    l.Logger.Info(msg, fields...)
}

func (l *zapLogger) Warn(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) {
    l.Logger.Warn(msg, fields...)
}

func (l *zapLogger) Error(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) {
    l.Logger.Error(msg, fields...)
}

func (l *zapLogger) Sync() error {
    return l.Logger.Sync()
}
```

- **Embedding Magic**: By embedding `*zap.Logger`, you get all its methods "for free" if you need them later, but we're explicitly implementing the interface for clarity.
- **Initialization**: Tie this into your `NewDependency` function from before. For example:

```go
// In deps package
func NewDependency() *Dependency {
    config := loadConfig()
    logger := NewZapLogger(config) // Now returns your Logger interface

    return &Dependency{
        Logger: logger,
        Config: config,
    }
}
```

- **Batch App Tip**: In `main`, call `dep.Logger.Sync()` before exiting to ensure all logs are flushed—important for batch jobs that might run in containers or scripts.

### Step 3: Using the Logger in Your Code
With this setup, your structs (like `BatchProcessor`) can access the logger via the embedded `Dependency`, and it remains injectable.

```go
// Example usage in BatchProcessor
func (bp *BatchProcessor) Process() {
    bp.Logger.Info("Starting batch process", zap.String("job_id", "123"))
    // Handle errors
    if err := someOperation(); err != nil {
        bp.Logger.Error("Operation failed", zap.Error(err))
        return err
    }
    return nil
}
```

- **Verbosity Reduced**: Still just `bp.Logger.Info(...)`—no extra wrapping in your business code.
- **Error Handling**: Zap's fields (e.g., `zap.Error(err)`) make logs structured and easy to query.

### Step 4: Mocking for Tests
This is where the interface shines. Use a mocking library like `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock` to create test doubles.

First, install it: `go get github.com/stretchr/testify`.

Then, in your tests:

```go
// batch_processor_test.go
import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
    "go.uber.org/zap"
)

// mockLogger is a testify mock implementing Logger.
type mockLogger struct {
    mock.Mock
}

func (m *mockLogger) Info(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) {
    m.Called(msg, fields)
}

func (m *mockLogger) Warn(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) {
    m.Called(msg, fields)
}

func (m *mockLogger) Error(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) {
    m.Called(msg, fields)
}

func (m *mockLogger) Sync() error {
    args := m.Called()
    return args.Error(0)
}

func TestBatchProcessor_Process(t *testing.T) {
    m := new(mockLogger)
    dep := &deps.Dependency{Logger: m}
    bp := NewBatchProcessor(dep)

    // Set up expectations
    m.On("Info", "Starting batch process", mock.Anything).Return()
    m.On("Sync").Return(nil)

    err := bp.Process()
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("unexpected error: %v", err)
    }

    m.AssertExpectations(t)
}
```

- **Why this?** You can verify that `Info` was called with specific args, without real logging. For variadic fields, use `mock.Anything` for flexibility.

### Additional Tips to Minimize Boilerplate
- **Code Generation**: If your interface grows, tools like `github.com/golang/mock/gomock` can auto-generate mocks, reducing manual mock writing.
- **Keep It Lean**: Only add interface methods as you use them. If your batch app doesn't need Debug logs, skip it.
- **Performance**: Zap is optimized, and this wrapper adds negligible overhead. Benchmark if concerned (e.g., with Go's testing.B).
- **Alternatives**: If wrapping feels too verbose, check community wrappers like `github.com/uber-go/zap/zaptest` for testing, but an interface is more flexible for DI.
- **Best Practice Alignment**: This follows Go's "interface segregation" principle (small interfaces) and keeps your code explicit.

This should integrate seamlessly with your DI setup and make logging testable without much added complexity. If you share more about your config setup, specific Zap configs you're using, or even a code snippet from your app, I can provide a more tailored example or help debug any issues. How's your batch app structured overall—any databases or external services involved? Let's keep building this! 😊

By doing this, I have to modify interface every time I need to add Zap’s functionality.
Also, If I want to create childLogger, what should I return?

Thank you for following up—these are excellent points and common pain points when wrapping third-party libraries like Zap in interfaces for DI. You're right that adding new functionality (e.g., a Debug method) requires updating the interface, which can feel like maintenance overhead. Similarly, handling child loggers (via Zap's `With` or `Sugar` methods) needs careful design to avoid leaking concrete types and breaking decoupling. The good news is there are idiomatic Go ways to handle both without excessive boilerplate, while keeping your code flexible and testable.

I'll address each concern step by step, building on our previous discussion. We'll refine the `Logger` interface and wrapper to make it more extensible, and I'll provide code examples. The goal is to minimize changes over time while preserving the benefits of DI.

### 1. Handling Interface Modifications When Adding Zap Functionality
Yes, this is a trade-off of using interfaces: they need to evolve with your needs. However, Go's design encourages small, focused interfaces (per the Interface Segregation Principle), so this isn't inherently bad—it's explicit and prevents bloat. Here's how to manage it effectively:

#### Why It Happens and How to Minimize Churn
- **Start Small and Add Incrementally**: Only include methods you *currently* use. If you later need `Debug`, add it then. This keeps the interface lean and reduces upfront work. In a batch app, you might not need everything Zap offers (e.g., no need for `Panic` if your app doesn't fatal-exit on errors).
- **Trade-Offs**: A minimal interface means occasional updates, but it's better than a massive one that exposes unused methods (which could tempt tight coupling). Updates are quick: add the method to the interface, implement it in `zapLogger`, and update mocks if needed.
- **Tools to Ease Maintenance**:
  - **Code Generation for Mocks**: Use `gomock` (from `github.com/golang/mock`) to auto-generate mocks. When you update the interface, re-run `mockgen`—it handles the boilerplate.
    - Install: `go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@latest`
    - Generate: `mockgen -source=deps/logger.go -destination=deps/mocks/mock_logger.go` (assuming your interface is in `logger.go`).
    - This replaces manual mocks like the `mockLogger` I showed earlier.
  - **Linting**: Tools like golangci-lint can flag unused interface methods, helping you keep it trim.
- **Alternative: A More Generic Interface**: If modifications become frequent, consider a "passthrough" method for less common features. For example, add a generic `Log(level zapcore.Level, msg string, fields ...zap.Field)` method. But this reduces type safety, so use sparingly.

#### Example: Adding a New Method (e.g., Debug)
Suppose you need to add Debug logging. Update like this:

```go
// package deps

// Logger interface (updated)
type Logger interface {
    Info(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Warn(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Error(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Debug(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) // New addition
    Sync() error
}

// In zapLogger implementation (add this method)
func (l *zapLogger) Debug(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) {
    l.Logger.Debug(msg, fields...)
}
```

- **Impact**: Your existing code doesn't break—only places needing Debug will use it. Re-generate mocks if using gomock.
- **Best Practice Tip**: Version your interfaces if your app is large (e.g., `LoggerV2`), but that's overkill for most batch apps.

If this still feels too burdensome, you could embed `*zap.Logger` directly in your `Dependency` struct without an interface—but that sacrifices mockability. I recommend sticking with the interface for now; the maintenance is usually minimal in practice.

### 2. Creating Child Loggers
Zap's `With` method (e.g., `logger.With(zap.String("request_id", "abc"))`) creates a child logger with pre-attached fields, which is super useful for context in batch jobs (e.g., logging per-task or per-file). To handle this in your interface:

- **What to Return?** Return the `Logger` *interface* type, not the concrete `*zap.Logger` or your `zapLogger`. This maintains decoupling—your business code never sees the underlying Zap type.
- **Why?** If you return a concrete type, you'd leak implementation details, defeating the purpose of the interface. Returning the interface keeps things injectable and mockable.
- **Implementation**: Add a `With` method to your `Logger` interface. In the wrapper, call Zap's `With` and wrap the result in a new `zapLogger`.

#### Updated Interface and Implementation
Add `With` to the interface:

```go
// package deps

import "go.uber.org/zap"

// Logger interface (with With added)
type Logger interface {
    Info(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Warn(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Error(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)
    Debug(msg string, fields ...zap.Field) // Assuming we added this
    Sync() error

    // With creates a child logger with the given fields attached.
    With(fields ...zap.Field) Logger // Returns the interface!
}

// In zapLogger implementation (add this method)
func (l *zapLogger) With(fields ...zap.Field) Logger {
    child := l.Logger.With(fields...) // Zap's With returns *zap.Logger
    return &zapLogger{Logger: child}  // Wrap and return as interface
}
```

- **Key Insight**: The child is still a `*zap.Logger` under the hood, but we immediately wrap it in `zapLogger` to satisfy the interface. This is efficient (no deep copying) and preserves Zap's performance.

#### Usage in Your Code
Now, in your structs (e.g., `BatchProcessor`), creating a child is seamless and type-safe:

```go
func (bp *BatchProcessor) Process(jobID string) {
    childLogger := bp.Logger.With(zap.String("job_id", jobID)) // Returns Logger interface

    childLogger.Info("Starting job")
    // All logs from childLogger will include "job_id"
    
    if err := someOperation(); err != nil {
        childLogger.Error("Job failed", zap.Error(err))
        return
    }
    childLogger.Sync() // Optional, if you want to flush per-child
}
```

- **Batch App Tip**: Use child loggers for parallelism (e.g., one per goroutine in a concurrent batch process) to add context like goroutine ID or batch chunk.

#### Mocking Child Loggers
In tests, your mock needs to implement `With`. With gomock, it's auto-generated. For a manual mock (using testify):

```go
// In your mockLogger
func (m *mockLogger) With(fields ...zap.Field) Logger {
    args := m.Called(fields)
    return args.Get(0).(Logger) // Return a mock or the same instance
}

// In test setup
m.On("With", mock.Anything).Return(m) // Simple: return self for testing
// Or return a new mock for more control
```

This lets you assert on child logger calls separately if needed.

### Integrating with Your Overall Setup
- **Dependency Struct**: No changes needed—`Dependency.Logger` is still the interface type.
- **NewZapLogger**: Remains the same; it returns the wrapped logger.
- **If You Need More Zap Features**: For things like `Sugar()` (Zap's sugared API), add a method like `Sugar() SugaredLogger` with another interface. But if you're using structured logging, you might not need it.
- **Alternatives if Overhead Builds**:
  - **No Interface for Logging**: If testing logs isn't critical (e.g., you use integration tests), inject `*zap.Logger` directly. But this reduces flexibility.
  - **Community Wrappers**: Libraries like `github.com/rs/zerolog` offer interfaces out-of-the-box, but switching from Zap might not be worth it.
  - **Functional Logging**: Pass logger functions (e.g., `type LogFunc func(msg string, fields ...zap.Field)`) instead of a full interface, but this can get verbose.

This refined setup should make your logger wrapper more future-proof without frequent disruptive changes. Adding methods as needed is normal and keeps things explicit—Go apps often evolve this way. If your app requires a lot of Zap features upfront, we could design a broader interface from the start.

How often do you anticipate adding new logging methods? Do you have specific Zap features (e.g., custom encoders, hooks) you're planning to use? Share a bit more about your batch logic or a code snippet, and I can provide a complete example or even a small gist/repo. Let's nail this! 😊
