### User

Help me build a batch application written in Go.
The batch application will perform these steps in order
1. Receive messages from SQS.
2. Retrieve the S3 bucket key from the message.
3. Get the S3 object, which is a CSV file, using the retrieved S3 bucket key.
4. Ignore the CSV header and insert the first line of the CSV file into a PostgreSQL database.
5. Send a GET request to an external web API with the key that is inside the CSV file.
6. Receive an HTTP response in JSON format, then parse the JSON into a map because its structure is unknown.
7. If the received HTTP response has a status code of 200, it includes an image file.
8. Upload the image file to S3.

I have already decided what library I will use.
- Zap for logging.
- Bun for access PostgreSQL.
- Viper for configuration management.
- aws-sdk-go-v2 for work around AWS.

the batch application has two modes which are almost identical, but both modes receive messages from different queues and insert the CSV data into different tables.
While building the batch application, I want to follow Go's best practices as much as possible.
To achieve this, I am considering the following two practices:
**1/2 Using Interfaces and Embedded Structs to express two similar modes with slight differences**
I think this is the best for my use case.
I want to use the Embedded Struct correctly.
Because I want to avoid using interfaces and structs for the 'Template Method' pattern, given that this pattern relies on inheritance in object-oriented languages.
I would like to use 'composition over inheritance'.
**2/2 Apply Singleton pattern to application config and logging instance**
I want the config and logging instances to be singletons.
Also, I would like to use the 'Dependency Injection' pattern to pass these instances.
By doing so, I would also avoid 'Prop Drilling,' which means functions are forced to carry around the singleton instance in their arguments.
To avoid this problem, I think it's better to have singleton instances within a struct.
Could you create a guide for building the batch application?
Each guide should comprehensively and deeply as possible.
To get start with, could you please provide the titles for each step and sub step?
I will ask about them individually later.

**Outlining the Core Elements**

I've been busy deconstructing the request. My current focus is on breaking down the user's instructions into manageable chunks. I'm prioritizing the identification of the essential steps for constructing a Go batch application. I'm focusing on the eight distinct workflow steps, ensuring I grasp each one's role.


**Refining the Workflow Steps**

I've been drilling deeper into the requirements. Now I'm meticulously examining each of the eight workflow steps, paying close attention to the potential edge cases. I'm focusing on clarifying potential ambiguities around the image file retrieval and upload, and incorporating the specific technology stack components. My plan includes an assessment of which AWS resources the application will interact with. I'm considering potential error handling and logging strategies.


**Structuring the Guide Content**

I'm now fully immersed in organizing the guide's structure. I'm focusing on crafting clear, concise headings and subheadings for each step and substep. I'm prioritizing logical flow to ensure the user, a Go expert, can easily grasp the workflow and implementation details. My aim is to make it a practical and accessible resource, avoiding repetition while clarifying any ambiguities identified previously.


**Refining the Architectural Model**

I'm now zeroing in on the architectural design. My plan is to emphasize composition through interfaces and structs to handle the two modes effectively. I'm focusing on defining clear interfaces for key functionalities and embedding structs for common behavior. This will allow for the dynamic selection of specific implementations at runtime. I'll also ensure that the singleton pattern is applied for config and logger, passing these through DI for clear separation of concerns.


**Developing the Application Foundation**

I'm currently finalizing the project's foundation. This involves setting up the directory structure and managing dependencies, a core requirement. I'm focusing on defining the configuration and logging components. My goal is to use the singleton and dependency injection patterns for a more maintainable and testable application. I'm in the process of defining the overall structure to ensure the two operational modes can be handled effectively.


**Structuring the Interface Design**

I'm currently engaged in designing the core interfaces that will facilitate the application's two operational modes. I'm focusing on creating a flexible architecture using interfaces for defining abstract actions and concrete structs for mode-specific implementations. My aim is to leverage dependency injection to manage and instantiate these components, adhering to best practices. I'm also planning to create a unified struct to manage dependencies.


**Developing the Concrete Implementations**

I'm now focusing on implementing each of the eight workflow steps. I'm focusing on creating concrete implementations for SQS, S3, PostgreSQL, and the external API interactions, adhering to the established interfaces and dependency injection principles. I'm also preparing to show examples on how the specific configurations and modes will be selected at run-time.


**Developing the Guide's Structure**

I'm now fully immersed in the guide's structure. My focus is crafting a clear, logical outline that a Go expert can easily follow. I'm prioritizing the inclusion of code snippets and examples to make the implementation process accessible. The aim is to create a resource that not only explains *how* to build the application but also helps to understand *why* particular architectural choices were made.


**Developing the Concrete Implementations**

I've been fully immersed in the coding phase. I'm focusing on crafting the concrete implementations for each workflow step, specifically for interactions with SQS, S3, PostgreSQL, and the external API. My plan also includes illustrating how configuration and mode selection will be managed at runtime.


**Crafting a Detailed Outline**

I've been occupied in structuring the guide. My focus is crafting a clear, logical outline that ensures a practical resource for the user, a Go expert, to easily follow. I'm prioritizing the inclusion of code snippets and examples to make the implementation process accessible. The aim is to clarify the *how* and *why* behind architectural choices.

**Clarifying the Core Goal**

I've been breaking down the user's request, focusing on the core goal: providing a comprehensive and deep explanation of project structure. Currently, I'm identifying the key components this explanation needs to include, such as the initial directory structure, the purpose of each directory, and the relationships between the files and the directory. I'm aiming to capture everything.


**Structuring the Project Details**

I'm now diving deeper into the nuances of project structure. I'm focusing on "Structuring the Project Directory," considering Go conventions, like the standard Go project layout, and the specific libraries the user is utilizing. I'm also planning for scalability and imagining the project's growth. I'm thinking about the placement of configurations, database setup, and logging components.


**Defining the Directory Layout**

I'm now focusing on the nuts and bolts, working on the directory tree for the project. I'm taking the initial brainstorm, and organizing that into a clear structure. I'm making sure it's visually presented, along with the reasoning behind each directory. I'm integrating that with Go conventions and the user's libraries, and I'm ensuring all the user's needs are accounted for.


**Refining the Directory Model**

I'm now revising my thinking on how to clearly present the project directory structure. My current aim is to create a visual representation, using a directory tree format. I want to convey not only the structure but also the reasoning behind each directory's inclusion. I'm focusing on incorporating both Go conventions and the user's libraries. I'm also ensuring the arrangement is understandable and adaptable to potential project growth.


**Developing a Comprehensive Model**

I'm now refining the explanation by creating a detailed visual directory tree, similar to `tree` output, offering a clear guide to the structure. I'm building on my previous iterations by detailing the reasoning behind each directory, and emphasizing Go best practices. I'm focusing on the modular design aspect, specifically how the `main.go` file should initialize and wire dependencies, rather than including business logic. I'm making sure to address the various libraries the user mentioned.


**Developing the Core Logic**

I'm now focusing on the "nuts and bolts," the actual implementation of the batch processor logic, specifically the `internal` directory structure. I'm visualizing the code layout and how the user's libraries fit. I'm considering interfaces and implementations, and their placement within the `internal` structure. I'm focusing on the DI container and the initialization in `main.go`. I'm making sure to cover all user requirements.

I've refined the explanation to focus on a `tree`-like structure, clarifying the logic behind each directory. I'm making sure the user has an immediate visual representation of the project structure and how the different components interact. I'm now working to build this structure into a clear, detailed model. I'm emphasizing Go best practices and ensuring it can scale.


**Finalizing the Visual Model**

Now I'm creating a clear and visual `tree`-like model to illustrate the proposed project structure. I'm taking the previous detailed breakdown and refining it into a user-friendly format, complete with explanations for each directory and the rationale behind it. I'm particularly emphasizing the `internal` directory's structure, highlighting its function in the application's design, and detailing how the user's libraries (Viper, Bun, Zap, and AWS SDK) are integrated within the structure.


**Elaborating the Internal Structure**

I'm now diving deep into the `internal` directory and the core logic components. I'm focusing on clarifying how the dependency injection container and processor logic should be initialized in `main.go`. I'm exploring the nuances of interface implementations and their placement within the `internal` structure. I'm ensuring everything aligns with the user's needs.



</details>

Excellent. Let's dive into the first step: structuring the project directory.

A well-organized directory structure is the foundation of a maintainable Go application. It improves clarity, enforces logical boundaries, and makes it easier for developers (including your future self) to navigate the codebase. We will follow a structure inspired by the community-accepted "Standard Go Project Layout," but tailored specifically for our batch application's needs.

---

### **Part 1.1: Structuring the Project Directory**

The goal is to separate concerns into distinct packages. This not only organizes files but also leverages Go's package system to create clear boundaries between different parts of our application, such as configuration, database logic, and core business logic.

#### **Proposed Directory Tree**

Here is the recommended structure for our project, which we'll name `go-batch-processor`:

```plaintext
go-batch-processor/
├── cmd/
│   └── app/
│       └── main.go
├── configs/
│   ├── config.development.yaml
│   └── config.production.yaml
├── internal/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── processor.go
│   │   └── run.go
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── config.go
│   ├── core/
│   │   └── dependencies.go
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── models.go
│   │   └── postgres.go
│   ├── external/
│   │   └── api_client.go
│   ├── logging/
│   │   └── logger.go
│   └── processor/
│       ├── aws.go
│       ├── mode_a.go
│       └── mode_b.go
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

#### **Detailed Explanation of Each Directory**

**1. `cmd/` - Application Entrypoints**
*   **Purpose:** This directory contains the `main` package for our executable application. The name `cmd` is a standard convention in Go projects for housing binaries.
*   **`cmd/app/main.go`**: This is the entry point of our batch application.
    *   **Responsibility:** Its role should be minimal. It is responsible for:
        1.  Initializing the configuration and logger singletons.
        2.  Building the central dependency container.
        3.  Instantiating the correct processor (`ModeA` or `ModeB`) based on the configuration.
        4.  Starting the application's main processing loop.
    *   **Best Practice:** Business logic should **not** live here. `main.go` is the conductor, not the orchestra. It wires everything together and kicks things off.

**2. `configs/` - Environment Configuration**
*   **Purpose:** This directory holds static configuration files for different environments.
*   **`config.development.yaml`, `config.production.yaml`**: We use YAML for its readability. These files will contain all the settings that change between environments, such as:
    *   Database connection strings.
    *   SQS queue URLs for each mode.
    *   AWS region.
    *   Logging levels (e.g., `debug` for development, `info` for production).
    *   External API endpoints.
*   **Best Practice:** Separating configuration from code is a core tenet of building scalable applications. It allows you to deploy the same compiled binary to different environments with only a change in the config file.

**3. `internal/` - Private Application Code**
*   **Purpose:** This is the most important directory in our project. The `internal` directory has a special behavior enforced by the Go compiler: **code within `internal` can only be imported by code inside the same parent directory (`go-batch-processor/`)**. This makes it the perfect place for all your application-specific business logic that you don't want other projects to import.
*   **`internal/app/`**: This package orchestrates the core application flow.
    *   `processor.go`: Will define the central `Processor` interface. This is the "contract" that both `ModeA` and `ModeB` must fulfill.
    *   `run.go`: Will contain the main application loop logic that polls SQS and delegates message processing.
*   **`internal/config/`**:
    *   `config.go`: This file will contain the Go struct that maps to our YAML configuration files and the logic to initialize and load the configuration using Viper. This will be our configuration singleton.
*   **`internal/core/`**:
    *   `dependencies.go`: This is the heart of our Dependency Injection pattern. It will define a struct that holds all the shared dependencies of our application: the logger, the configuration, the database connection pool, and AWS clients.
*   **`internal/database/`**:
    *   `postgres.go`: Contains all the logic for connecting to PostgreSQL using `Bun`. It will also define the functions for inserting data into the database tables.
    *   `models.go`: Defines the Go structs that map to your database tables for `Bun` to use.
*   **`internal/external/`**:
    *   `api_client.go`: Contains the logic for making the HTTP GET request to the external web API and handling the response.
*   **`internal/logging/`**:
    *   `logger.go`: Contains the logic to initialize our `Zap` logger. This will be our logger singleton.
*   **`internal/processor/`**: This package holds the concrete implementations of our business logic.
    *   `aws.go`: Contains helper functions for interacting with AWS services (SQS, S3) using the AWS SDK.
    *   `mode_a.go`: The implementation of the `Processor` interface for "Mode A". It will handle the specific SQS queue, S3 interactions, and database table for this mode.
    *   `mode_b.go`: The implementation of the `Processor` interface for "Mode B".

**4. Root Files**
*   **`go.mod` & `go.sum`**: These are standard Go module files. `go.mod` defines the project's module path and its dependencies, while `go.sum` contains the checksums of those dependencies to ensure build reproducibility.

This structure provides a clean separation of concerns and sets us up perfectly to implement the singleton and dependency injection patterns you requested. Each package has a single, clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

> dependencies.go

I think this name is little bit awkward.
Are there any alternatives?
What are the common naming for this use case based on best practices in Go.

**Examining Naming Alternatives**

I've been analyzing the user's main concern: the awkward name `dependencies.go`. I'm now exploring alternative naming conventions and considering Go best practices for a centralized struct.  My focus is on finding a more elegant and intuitive name, considering the context of a central struct.


**Considering Better Names**

I've moved past simple file naming and am now diving into potential struct names.  `Container`, `Application`, and `State` are promising, each capturing a facet of its role. I'm weighing their strengths based on clarity and alignment with Go best practices. The "application" name feels quite tempting as the central struct represents the application's overall state.


**Defining Optimal Terminology**

I'm now zeroing in on the best terminology, specifically for the struct's role. "Application" feels appropriate since it contains the application's overall state. I'm carefully considering how to frame the answer, emphasizing clarity and Go's idiomatic conventions. The key is conveying the essence of a shared dependency container.


**Revising Recommendation Criteria**

I'm now prioritizing clarity and adherence to Go idioms. "Application" remains strong, representing the application's global state, but "environment" emerges as possibly superior for its widespread use in Go projects and its semantic fit. I'm focusing on providing practical examples in my answer to solidify these recommendations.


**Prioritizing Clarity in Recommendations**

I'm now focusing on practical implementation, specifically a directory structure for my example code. I'll outline the current structure and the changes if the user adopts "app.go," ensuring the answer is actionable.  I'm also considering the implications of recommending either `Application` or `Environment`.


**Prioritizing Practical Action**

I've decided to structure my answer around a clear directory structure change for the user. I'll propose shifting from `internal/core/dependencies.go` to `internal/app/app.go`, if they choose the `Application` struct. This aims to make the recommendation truly actionable.



</details>

That's an excellent point. You've hit on a subtle but important aspect of idiomatic Go development. The name `dependencies.go` is functionally correct but feels a bit generic and mechanical, almost like a direct translation from another language's dependency injection framework.

In Go, the community often prefers names that describe the *purpose* or *role* of the struct, rather than simply labeling it as a "container of things." Let's explore the common alternatives and best practices.

The purpose of this struct is to hold all the shared, long-lived dependencies (like the logger, configuration, and database connection pool) that are required for your application's logic to run. It represents the overall state and capabilities of your running application instance.

Here are the most common and idiomatic naming conventions for this pattern, along with their rationale:

---

### **Top Recommendations**

#### 1. **`app.go` (Struct: `Application` or `App`)**

This is arguably the most intuitive and descriptive name for our use case. The struct represents the entire application.

*   **Rationale:** Your `main.go` will create an instance of this `Application` struct. This instance *is* the application. It holds everything needed to `Run()`. This naming is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the struct's role.
*   **Example:**
    ```go
    // in internal/app/app.go
    package app

    import (
        "database/sql"
        "go.uber.org/zap"
        "github.com/uptrace/bun"
        "your_project/internal/config"
    )

    // Application holds the application's dependencies.
    type Application struct {
        Config *config.Config
        Logger *zap.Logger
        DB     *bun.DB
        // ... other clients like S3, SQS etc.
    }
    ```

#### 2. **`env.go` (Struct: `Env` or `Environment`)**

This is another very popular and idiomatic choice, especially common in web applications, but perfectly suitable here.

*   **Rationale:** This name suggests that the struct provides the "environment" in which your business logic (your processors or handlers) will execute. It provides all the external connections and configuration needed for a piece of logic to do its job. Many prominent Go developers and resources advocate for this pattern.
*   **Example:**
    ```go
    // in internal/app/env.go
    package app

    // Env holds the application's dependencies, providing an
    // environment for handlers to run in.
    type Env struct {
        Config *config.Config
        Logger *zap.Logger
        DB     *bun.DB
    }
    ```

---

### **Other Viable Alternatives**

*   **`server.go` (Struct: `Server`)**: This is common if your application primarily serves requests (like an HTTP server). For a batch application that polls and processes, it's a slightly less natural fit but still a reasonable choice if you think of it as a long-running "server" process.
*   **`container.go` (Struct: `Container`)**: This is very clear and comes directly from the "Dependency Injection Container" pattern name. While perfectly understandable, it can feel a bit like jargon imported from other ecosystems (like Java's Spring or PHP's Symfony). `Application` or `Env` are generally considered more idiomatic in Go.

---

### **A Name to Avoid**

*   **`context.go` (Struct: `Context`)**: **Do not use this name.** In Go, `context` is a universally understood package (`context.Context`) used for cancellation, deadlines, and passing request-scoped values. Naming your dependency struct `Context` would create significant confusion and lead to unreadable code. Imagine a function signature like this:
    ```go
    // Very confusing! Which one is which?
    func (c *Context) ProcessMessage(ctx context.Context, msg *sqs.Message) error
    ```

---

### **Final Recommendation and Project Structure Update**

For your batch application, **`app.go` with an `Application` struct is the strongest choice.** It perfectly describes the top-level object that represents your running process.

Let's update the proposed directory structure with this more idiomatic naming. I'll also take this opportunity to refine the location. Since `Application` is the core of the `app` package, it makes sense for it to live there, removing the need for a separate `core` package.

**Updated Directory Tree:**

```diff
go-batch-processor/
├── cmd/
│   └── app/
│       └── main.go
├── configs/
│   ├── config.development.yaml
│   └── config.production.yaml
├── internal/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── app.go              <-- RENAMED & MOVED from internal/core/dependencies.go
│   │   ├── processor.go
│   │   └── run.go
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── config.go
- │   ├── core/
- │   │   └── dependencies.go
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── models.go
│   │   └── postgres.go
│   ├── external/
│   │   └── api_client.go
│   ├── logging/
│   │   └── logger.go
│   └── processor/
│       ├── aws.go
│       ├── mode_a.go
│       └── mode_b.go
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

This revised structure is cleaner and more aligned with Go best practices. The `internal/app` package now logically contains the definition of the `Application` itself, the interface (`Processor`) it works with, and the `Run` method that starts it.


---

### User

I think `mode_a.go` and `mode_b.go` each have their own struct. How about putting these singleton instances into the struct? If you have a specific reason for having separate modules, could you explain it to me?

<summary>Reasoning</summary>

**Exploring Singleton Integration**

I've been examining the user's question, breaking down their central query regarding the integration of singletons like loggers and config into components such as `ModeAProcessor` and `ModeBProcessor`. I'm focusing on the core concept of dependency injection versus directly embedding these singletons. Initial thoughts suggest an exploration of the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, particularly in the context of maintainability and testability.


**Refining DI Considerations**

I'm now delving deeper into the nuances of dependency injection versus direct embedding. The core advantage of DI in this context seems to be enhanced testability, a critical factor for maintainable code. I'm exploring how DI simplifies mocking of dependencies, allowing for isolated testing of components like `ModeAProcessor` without real-world singletons interfering. The goal is to provide a well-reasoned answer grounded in practical implications.


**Analyzing Tradeoffs Now**

I'm currently engaged in a comprehensive analysis of the tradeoffs between embedding singletons and employing dependency injection. I'm focusing on the practical ramifications of each approach, particularly concerning dependency management, initialization, and code duplication. My goal is to synthesize these points into a clear and defensible recommendation for the user, solidifying the rationale behind my prior suggestion.


**Contrasting Initialization Strategies**

I'm now detailing the implications of each approach, specifically focusing on how they handle dependency initialization. My analysis highlights how embedding singletons leads to duplicated code and cumbersome initialization logic, especially as the number of dependencies increases. This emphasizes the benefits of a centralized dependency management approach for code clarity and scalability.


**Synthesizing Recommendations**

I'm now consolidating my analysis, specifically on dependency management and testability. I've highlighted that while direct embedding might seem simpler initially, it quickly leads to duplication and more complex initialization procedures. My recommendation leans toward centralizing dependencies in an `Application` struct, as it offers a cleaner, more testable, and maintainable solution.


**Reiterating Dependency Advantages**

I'm now emphasizing the advantages of dependency injection for maintainability and testability, elaborating on how a centralized `Application` struct streamlines dependency management and reduces code duplication. This structure inherently increases the clarity of the architecture, where shared resources are clearly represented. It simplifies dependency initialization and facilitates more straightforward testing.


**Revising Initialization Logic**

Now, I'm analyzing the initial setup phase for shared dependencies. The process of centralizing these components in a single location simplifies initialization. Direct instantiation results in repetitive constructor calls, thus increasing complexity, especially when adding new dependencies. A centralized container eases this burden, facilitating easier configuration and a cleaner codebase overall.


**Analyzing Testability Implications**

I'm evaluating the specific implications of dependency injection regarding testability. In essence, by centralizing dependencies, it becomes trivial to create mock application instances with the desired behaviors for individual processor tests. This approach enables focused testing, allowing for robust and dependable unit tests. In addition, it enhances the ability to substitute specific components within an isolated test environment.



</details>

That's a very insightful question, and it gets to a fundamental design choice in Go. Your intuition is correct—the `mode_a.go` and `mode_b.go` files will each define their own struct.

The idea of putting the singleton instances directly into those structs is a valid approach. Let's call this **Approach A**.

The approach I recommended, using a central `Application` struct, is **Approach B**.

Let's compare them directly. The reason for having the separate `Application` module (Approach B) is to solve several key problems related to duplication, maintenance, and clarity that arise with Approach A.

---

### **Approach A: Embedding Dependencies in Each Concrete Processor**

In this model, the structs would look like this:

```go
// in internal/processor/mode_a.go
type ModeAProcessor struct {
    // --- Duplicated Dependencies ---
    Config *config.Config
    Logger *zap.Logger
    DB     *bun.DB
    // ... other shared clients (S3, etc.)
    // -----------------------------

    // Specific fields for Mode A, if any
}

// in internal/processor/mode_b.go
type ModeBProcessor struct {
    // --- Duplicated Dependencies ---
    Config *config.Config
    Logger *zap.Logger
    DB     *bun.DB
    // ... other shared clients (S3, etc.)
    // -----------------------------

    // Specific fields for Mode B, if any
}
```

**Problems with this approach:**

1.  **Code Duplication:** The list of shared dependencies (`Config`, `Logger`, `DB`, etc.) is explicitly duplicated in both `ModeAProcessor` and `ModeBProcessor`. If you need to add a new shared dependency (e.g., a Redis client), you must remember to add it to **both** structs. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and is a common source of bugs and maintenance headaches.

2.  **Repetitive Initialization:** In your `main.go`, the code to create an instance of each processor would be nearly identical and very long.

    ```go
    // In main.go, with Approach A
    if cfg.Mode == "A" {
        p := processor.NewModeAProcessor(
            appConfig, // arg 1
            appLogger, // arg 2
            db,        // arg 3
            s3Client,  // arg 4
            // ...imagine 5 more args
        )
        // ...
    } else {
        p := processor.NewModeBProcessor(
            appConfig, // arg 1
            appLogger, // arg 2
            db,        // arg 3
            s3Client,  // arg 4
            // ...imagine 5 more args
        )
        // ...
    }
    ```
    The list of arguments is long and identical, which is a strong "code smell."

---

### **Approach B: Central `Application` Struct (Dependency Injection)**

This is the recommended approach. We define the shared dependencies **only once** in the `app.Application` struct.

```go
// in internal/app/app.go
package app

// Application holds all shared application dependencies.
// This is our single source of truth for dependencies.
type Application struct {
    Config   *config.Config
    Logger   *zap.Logger
    DB       *bun.DB
    S3Client *s3.Client
    // ... any other shared clients
}
```

Then, our processors simply hold a reference to this `Application` struct. This is where the **composition** you wanted comes into play.

```go
// in internal/processor/mode_a.go

// ModeAProcessor implements the app.Processor interface for Mode A.
// It embeds a pointer to the Application struct to gain access
// to all shared dependencies like the logger and DB connection.
type ModeAProcessor struct {
    *app.Application // Embedded pointer to the central dependency struct
}

// NewModeAProcessor creates a new processor for Mode A.
func NewModeA-Processor(app *app.Application) *ModeAProcessor {
    return &ModeAProcessor{Application: app}
}

func (p *ModeAProcessor) Process() error {
    // We can now access all dependencies directly!
    p.Logger.Info("Starting Mode A processing...")
    // ... use p.DB, p.Config, etc.
    return nil
}
```

**Advantages of this approach:**

1.  **Single Source of Truth (DRY):** The list of dependencies is defined in exactly one place: `app.Application`. If you need to add a Redis client, you add it to the `Application` struct, and it's instantly available to *both* processors without any changes to `mode_a.go` or `mode_b.go`.

2.  **Clean Initialization:** The initialization logic in `main.go` becomes much cleaner. You build the `Application` object once, and then pass that single object to the processor's constructor.

    ```go
    // In main.go, with Approach B
    
    // 1. Build the dependency struct ONCE.
    application := &app.Application{
        Config:   appConfig,
        Logger:   appLogger,
        DB:       db,
        S3Client: s3Client,
    }

    // 2. Select and instantiate the processor by passing ONE argument.
    var p app.Processor
    if application.Config.App.Mode == "A" {
        p = processor.NewModeAProcessor(application)
    } else {
        p = processor.NewModeBProcessor(application)
    }
    ```

3.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:** This pattern creates a very clear architectural boundary.
    *   `app.Application`: Represents the **environment** or **context** of the application. It owns the long-lived, shared resources.
    *   `ModeAProcessor` / `ModeBProcessor`: Represent the **business logic** that *runs within* that environment. They don't own the dependencies; they just use them.

4.  **Fulfills Your Requirements Perfectly:**
    *   **Dependency Injection:** This is exactly what DI is. We are "injecting" the `Application` struct (which contains all dependencies) into our processors.
    *   **Avoids Prop Drilling:** Instead of passing `(logger, config, db, ...)` through multiple function calls, we pass a single, neat `*app.Application` pointer.

In summary, while it might seem like an extra layer at first, creating the central `app.Application` struct is a cornerstone of building a scalable and maintainable Go application. It directly addresses the problems of code duplication and complex initialization, leading to a much cleaner and more robust design.

**Reframing the Approach**

I've registered the user's definitive selection of Approach A. This is the new north star. My mission now becomes purely supporting Approach A, adjusting my previous assumptions and building a helpful guide based on this new premise. The prior recommendation for Approach B is no longer relevant; I'm pivoting entirely.


**Shifting to Focus**

I now understand that "Approach A" is the definitive route. I'm focusing on adapting the guide to reflect this. The previous recommendation is off the table, and I'm updating my mental framework to fully accommodate this shift. I'm actively reassessing the impact on the guide's structure.


**Prioritizing Initialization Steps**

The user's preference for "Approach A" is firmly in place. I've broken down the initialization phase, focusing on `go.mod` and third-party libraries. I'm prioritizing the steps, starting with project directory creation and emphasizing `go mod init` and `go get`. The new processor structs require a different setup, which I'm taking into account. I'll need to specify different Bun packages.


**Detailing Initialization Flow**

I'm now fully committed to the steps for Approach A. I'm focusing on the practical "Initializing Go Modules and Dependencies" section. The plan is to guide the user from project directory creation, explaining `go mod init`, and then adding specific dependencies: Zap, Bun (core, Postgres dialect, and driver), Viper, and the AWS SDK v2 (config, SQS, and S3). I'll provide a sample `go.mod` to check against and briefly explain the `go.sum` file's purpose. I am building a clear, hands-on path for their project setup, starting with the very first steps.


**Finalizing Initialization Plan**

I'm now fully committed to the revised plan, and have broken down the initialization phase further. I've re-written the guide section to explicitly cover `go mod init`, installing Zap, Bun, Viper, and the AWS SDK v2, with specific package paths. I've added a sample `go.mod` file and a brief explanation of `go.sum`. I'm focused on clear, step-by-step instructions.



</details>

Of course. We will proceed with **Approach A**, where each processor struct holds its own dependency fields. I will tailor the rest of the guide to this design choice.

Let's move on to the next step: initializing the project and its dependencies.

---

### **Part 1.2: Initializing Go Modules and Dependencies**

Before we can write any code, we need to set up our project as a Go module and download the external libraries we'll be using. A Go module is a collection of Go packages that are released together. The `go.mod` file is the heart of a module, defining its identity and tracking its dependencies.

This process involves three main actions:
1.  Creating the project directory.
2.  Initializing the Go module using the `go mod init` command.
3.  Adding our chosen libraries (`Zap`, `Viper`, `Bun`, `aws-sdk-go-v2`) using the `go get` command.

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

**1. Create the Project Directory**

First, create the root directory for your project based on the structure we defined.

```bash
# Create the root directory
mkdir go-batch-processor

# Navigate into it
cd go-batch-processor

# Create the rest of the directory structure
mkdir -p cmd/app
mkdir -p configs
mkdir -p internal/app
mkdir -p internal/config
mkdir -p internal/database
mkdir -p internal/external
mkdir -p internal/logging
mkdir -p internal/processor
```

Your project is now physically laid out and ready for Go module initialization.

**2. Initialize the Go Module**

Now, from the root of your `go-batch-processor` directory, run the `go mod init` command. This command creates a new `go.mod` file, which officially marks this directory as the root of a Go module.

You need to provide a "module path". This is the unique identifier for your module. The common convention is to use a URL-like path, typically corresponding to where you might host your code, such as a GitHub repository.

```bash
# Replace 'your-username' with your actual GitHub username or organization
go mod init github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor
```

After running this, you will see a new file, `go.mod`, in your project root. Initially, it will be very simple:

```go
// go.mod
module github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor

go 1.22 // Or your current Go version
```

**3. Add Dependencies with `go get`**

Next, we'll use the `go get` command to download and install the necessary libraries. This command will automatically find the latest stable versions of these packages and update your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

Run the following commands from your project root:

```bash
# For logging with Zap
go get go.uber.org/zap

# For configuration management with Viper
go get github.com/spf13/viper

# For PostgreSQL access with Bun
# We need the core library, the PostgreSQL dialect, and the driver
go get github.com/uptrace/bun
go get github.com/uptrace/bun/dialect/pgdialect
go get github.com/uptrace/bun/driver/pgdriver

# For AWS SDK for Go v2
# We need the core config loader and clients for SQS and S3
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/sqs
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3
```

**4. Review the Results**

After running these commands, your `go.mod` file will be updated to include all these new dependencies. It will look something like this (versions may vary):

```go
// go.mod
module github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor

go 1.22

require (
	github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config v1.27.26
	github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3 v1.58.2
	github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/sqs v1.37.2
	github.com/spf13/viper v1.19.0
	github.com/uptrace/bun v1.2.1
	github.com/uptrace/bun/dialect/pgdialect v1.2.1
	github.com/uptrace/bun/driver/pgdriver v1.2.1
	go.uber.org/zap v1.27.0
)

// The 'indirect' section will also be populated with
// dependencies of the packages we just installed.
// ... (many lines of indirect dependencies)
```

You will also see a new `go.sum` file. This file contains the cryptographic checksums of the direct and indirect dependencies. Its purpose is to ensure that future builds of your project use the exact same versions of dependencies, guaranteeing build reproducibility and security. You should commit both `go.mod` and `go.sum` to your version control system (e.g., Git).

---

We have now successfully set up our project structure and installed all the necessary third-party libraries. The project is ready for us to start writing the actual application code. Our next step will be to implement the configuration singleton using Viper.

**Exploring the Request's Nuances**

I'm currently dissecting the user's request. It's becoming clearer that the focus is on a detailed explanation of Part 1, specifically Step 3: Implementing the Configuration Singleton using Viper. My initial thoughts are centered around the core requirements, which include a detailed explanation. I'm starting to identify the key components needed to fully address the user's need.


**Refining the Explanation's Structure**

I've refined the explanation's structure. I'm focusing on "The 'Why'" of Viper and singleton patterns before diving into the code. My aim is to make the purpose and benefits clear first. I'll provide a concise overview of why this approach enhances code maintainability and testability before providing code samples.


**Structuring the Explanation's Flow**

I'm solidifying the structure. My current focus is on a logical flow: introducing the goal, explaining "why," and then detailed, step-by-step code explanations. I'll define the configuration struct and create a concrete YAML example to help clarify the approach.  The main part will focus on using `sync.Once` and `GetConfig()` to implement a singleton, and finally, using `loadConfig` to handle Viper logic.


**Elaborating Viper Implementation**

I'm now fully immersed in the Viper implementation details. I'm focusing on crafting a very clear explanation of `sync.Once` and its role in creating a thread-safe singleton. I'm also finalizing the structure of the `loadConfig` function, breaking it down into logical steps with inline comments that will be useful for the user. I'll include detailed explanations of how Viper handles environment variables and config file overrides. I intend to provide a complete, commented `config.go` file as the final output.


**Finalizing the Code Structure**

I'm now putting the finishing touches on the code structure. I'm ensuring the file paths and package names are correct and that all the necessary components are present. I'm focusing on providing detailed comments throughout the code, including explanations for the `sync.Once` implementation and how environment variables are handled with Viper. I'll provide a concise section demonstrating usage within a main function.


**Consolidating and Refining Details**

I'm now fully immersed in the details. I've begun to flesh out the concrete example for the `config.development.yaml` file, ensuring its structure aligns perfectly with the defined `Config` struct. I'm focusing on ensuring clear, concise comments within the YAML to clarify each field's purpose. I'm also preparing for the detailed explanation of `sync.Once` and the `loadConfig` function to ensure they are both technically sound and easy to understand.



</details>

Of course. Let's build the configuration management component.

This step is crucial for creating a flexible application that can run in different environments (like development, staging, and production) without changing the code. We will use Viper to read settings from a YAML file and implement the singleton pattern to ensure there's only one configuration object throughout the application's lifecycle.

---

### **Part 1.3: Implementing the Configuration Singleton (Viper)**

Our goal is to create a package that:
1.  Defines a Go struct that mirrors the structure of our configuration file.
2.  Uses Viper to read a YAML file (e.g., `configs/config.development.yaml`) and load its values into the struct.
3.  Provides a single, global access point (`GetConfig()`) to this configuration object, ensuring it's loaded only once using Go's `sync.Once` for thread-safety.

#### **Step 1: Define the YAML Configuration File**

First, let's create the actual configuration file. This file will live in the `configs/` directory and contain all the settings our application needs.

Create the file `configs/config.development.yaml`:

```yaml
# configs/config.development.yaml

# Application-specific settings
app:
  mode: "A" # Can be "A" or "B"
  log_level: "debug" # Log level for development

# AWS settings
aws:
  region: "us-east-1"
  sqs_queue_url_mode_a: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/mode-a-queue-dev"
  sqs_queue_url_mode_b: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/mode-b-queue-dev"
  s3_image_bucket: "my-image-bucket-dev"

# PostgreSQL database settings
postgres:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
  user: "postgres"
  password: "password"
  dbname: "batch_app_dev"
  sslmode: "disable"

# External API settings
external_api:
  base_url: "https://api.example.com/v1"
```

#### **Step 2: Implement the Configuration Singleton in Go**

Now, we'll write the Go code in `internal/config/config.go`. This file will contain the logic to load the YAML file and expose it as a singleton.

Create the file `internal/config/config.go`:

```go
package config

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
	"sync"

	"github.com/spf13/viper"
)

// Config holds all configuration for the application.
// The structure of this struct is mapped directly from the YAML file.
type Config struct {
	App struct {
		Mode     string `mapstructure:"mode"`
		LogLevel string `mapstructure:"log_level"`
	} `mapstructure:"app"`
	AWS struct {
		Region             string `mapstructure:"region"`
		SQSQueueURLModeA   string `mapstructure:"sqs_queue_url_mode_a"`
		SQSQueueURLModeB   string `mapstructure:"sqs_queue_url_mode_b"`
		S3ImageBucket      string `mapstructure:"s3_image_bucket"`
	} `mapstructure:"aws"`
	Postgres struct {
		Host     string `mapstructure:"host"`
		Port     int    `mapstructure:"port"`
		User     string `mapstructure:"user"`
		Password string `mapstructure:"password"`
		DBName   string `mapstructure:"dbname"`
		SSLMode  string `mapstructure:"sslmode"`
	} `mapstructure:"postgres"`
	ExternalAPI struct {
		BaseURL string `mapstructure:"base_url"`
	} `mapstructure:"external_api"`
}

// We use package-level variables to hold the singleton instance and a sync.Once
// to ensure the initialization code runs exactly once.
var (
	configInstance *Config
	once           sync.Once
)

// GetConfig is the public accessor for the configuration singleton.
// It uses sync.Once to guarantee that the configuration is loaded only
// one time, making it safe for concurrent use.
func GetConfig() *Config {
	once.Do(func() {
		// The 'Do' function will be executed only on the first call to GetConfig.
		configInstance = loadConfig()
	})
	return configInstance
}

// loadConfig performs the actual loading of the configuration using Viper.
func loadConfig() *Config {
	v := viper.New()

	// 1. Set the file name of the configurations file
	v.SetConfigName("config.development") // name of config file (without extension)
	// 2. Set the type of the configuration file
	v.SetConfigType("yaml")
	// 3. Set the path to look for the configuration file in
	v.AddConfigPath("./configs") // path to look for the config file in
	v.AddConfigPath(".")         // optionally look in the working directory

	// 4. Enable reading from environment variables
	// This allows overriding config file settings with environment variables.
	// e.g., POSTGRES_HOST=db.prod.com ./go-batch-processor
	v.SetEnvKeyReplacer(strings.NewReplacer(".", "_"))
	v.AutomaticEnv()

	// 5. Read the configuration file
	if err := v.ReadInConfig(); err != nil {
		// If the file is not found, it's a fatal error.
		panic(fmt.Errorf("fatal error config file: %w", err))
	}

	// 6. Unmarshal the configuration into our Go struct
	var cfg Config
	if err := v.Unmarshal(&cfg); err != nil {
		// If unmarshaling fails, it's a fatal error.
		panic(fmt.Errorf("unable to decode into struct, %w", err))
	}

	return &cfg
}
```

#### **Comprehensive Explanation**

1.  **The `Config` Struct:** We define a `Config` struct with nested structs (`App`, `AWS`, etc.). This organization makes the code cleaner. The `mapstructure` tags (e.g., `` `mapstructure:"log_level"` ``) tell Viper exactly which YAML key maps to which struct field.

2.  **Singleton Pattern with `sync.Once`:**
    *   We declare two package-level variables: `configInstance *Config` to hold our loaded configuration, and `once sync.Once`.
    *   `sync.Once` is a standard library type that provides a `Do` method. The function you pass to `Do` is **guaranteed** to be executed exactly once, no matter how many goroutines call it simultaneously. This is the most idiomatic and robust way to implement lazy, thread-safe initialization in Go.
    *   The public `GetConfig()` function is the only way for other parts of our application to get the configuration. The first time it's called, `once.Do(func() { ... })` executes our `loadConfig` function and stores the result in `configInstance`. Every subsequent call to `GetConfig()` will skip the `Do` block and immediately return the already-loaded `configInstance`.

3.  **Viper Logic (`loadConfig`)**:
    *   `viper.New()`: We create a new, local Viper instance. It's good practice not to use Viper's global instance to avoid potential conflicts.
    *   `SetConfigName`, `SetConfigType`, `AddConfigPath`: These methods tell Viper where to find our configuration file. We've pointed it to the `configs/` directory to look for a file named `config.development.yaml`.
    *   `AutomaticEnv()` and `SetEnvKeyReplacer()`: This is a powerful feature. It allows you to override any configuration value with an environment variable. For example, you could set `export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret` in your shell, and it would override the `password` value from the YAML file. The replacer changes the `.` in keys (like `postgres.password`) to `_` (like `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`) to match environment variable conventions.
    *   `ReadInConfig()`: This command finds and reads the file.
    *   `Unmarshal(&cfg)`: This is the final step where Viper maps the values it read into our `Config` struct.
    *   `panic()`: We use `panic` here because a missing or malformed configuration is a fatal, unrecoverable error. The application cannot run without its configuration, so it's appropriate to stop execution immediately.

#### **How to Use It**

Now, from any other package in your project, you can get the fully loaded configuration with a single line of code:

```go
// Example usage in another file, e.g., main.go
import "github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor/internal/config"

func main() {
    // Get the singleton instance. The first call will load it.
    appConfig := config.GetConfig()

    // Now you can use it
    fmt.Println("Running in mode:", appConfig.App.Mode)
    fmt.Println("PostgreSQL Host:", appConfig.Postgres.Host)
}
```

We have successfully created a robust, reusable, and thread-safe configuration module for our application.

**Refining the Request**

I'm now focusing on dissecting the user's request, specifically "Part 1, Step 4: Implementing the Logger Singleton (Zap)." This involves pinpointing the exact requirements for a Zap logger singleton, breaking down the task into manageable components, and clarifying the desired outputs. I am currently working on documenting the user's implicit and explicit needs.


**Analyzing the Requirements**

I've moved on to examining the goals of the requested logger singleton. It's becoming clearer that we need a high-speed, consistent logging solution accessible from anywhere in the application. I am considering the performance implications of not having a singleton and the benefits of using a single point of access for logging. I am leaning toward the importance of unified logging format and destination.


**Developing the Code Structure**

I'm now diving into the code structure, focusing on the `internal/logging/logger.go` file. I'm prioritizing clarity and maintainability. I've pinpointed key aspects: the necessary imports (go.uber.org/zap, sync, and others), the structure of the singleton instance, and the methods for initialization and usage. My current focus is how to create a simple to use implementation while achieving maximum utility. I'm exploring different methods to make sure the logger singleton fits nicely into the existing project.


**Formulating the Implementation**

I'm now deep-diving into the implementation details of the logger singleton. I've realized I need to access the log level from the application's configuration. I am carefully constructing `internal/logging/logger.go`, aiming for clarity and ease of use. I'm focusing on incorporating `go.uber.org/zap`, `sync`, and our configuration package. I'm considering best practices to ensure it works smoothly within the existing project.


**Defining the Logger's Architecture**

I'm now fully immersed in constructing the framework for the logger's explanation. My immediate focus is detailing the structure of the `internal/logging/logger.go` file. I plan to present the package, imports, and core components of the singleton in a straightforward manner. My primary concern is ensuring clarity and ease of comprehension, considering the user's expertise. I'm exploring different methods to make sure the logger singleton works well within the project. I will delve into the implementation details and dependencies such as `go.uber.org/zap`, `sync`, and the configuration.


**Developing the Implementation Plan**

I'm presently building the scaffolding for the singleton's explanation. This involves dissecting the user's requirements, formulating the code structure within `internal/logging/logger.go`, and meticulously detailing the essential components, such as the `GetLogger` function and the initialization logic. I am currently concentrating on incorporating Zap and the configuration package to ensure the singleton adheres to best practices and integrates smoothly within the project.


**Developing the Logger Singleton**

I'm currently structuring the explanation, laying out the fundamental elements of the `internal/logging/logger.go` file. The structure includes key aspects, such as the public `GetLogger` function, the `newLogger` function, and how it all works. I'm focusing on clarifying how the Singleton pattern is implemented, the role of Zap, and integrating with the application's configuration for dynamic log levels.



</details>

Excellent. Let's proceed with creating the logger singleton.

Just like with configuration, we want a single, globally accessible logger instance to ensure all parts of our application produce consistent, structured logs. Using Zap will give us high-performance logging that can be easily configured to output human-readable text in development and machine-readable JSON in production.

---

### **Part 1.4: Implementing the Logger Singleton (Zap)**

We will follow the exact same singleton pattern we used for the configuration, leveraging `sync.Once` for thread-safe, lazy initialization. The logger's behavior (e.g., its log level) will be driven by the configuration we just created.

#### **Step 1: Implement the Logger Singleton in Go**

We'll write this logic in the `internal/logging/logger.go` file. This package will be responsible for creating and providing the application-wide logger.

Create the file `internal/logging/logger.go`:

```go
package logging

import (
	"sync"

	"go.uber.org/zap"
	"go.uber.org/zap/zapcore"
	"your_project_path/internal/config" // Replace with your actual module path
)

var (
	loggerInstance *zap.Logger
	once           sync.Once
)

// GetLogger provides a singleton instance of a Zap logger.
// It initializes the logger on its first call, using the configuration
// from the config singleton.
func GetLogger() *zap.Logger {
	once.Do(func() {
		loggerInstance = newLogger()
	})
	return loggerInstance
}

// newLogger creates a new Zap logger based on the application configuration.
// It can create different logger configurations for development and production.
func newLogger() *zap.Logger {
	// First, get the application configuration.
	cfg := config.GetConfig()

	var logger *zap.Logger
	var err error

	// Choose the logger configuration based on the log level in the config file.
	// This allows us to have human-readable logs in development and structured
	// JSON logs in production.
	switch cfg.App.LogLevel {
	case "debug":
		// Development logger is more verbose, includes caller info, and has
		// a human-friendly, colorized console output.
		config := zap.NewDevelopmentConfig()
		// We can also set the level from our config if we want more control
		config.Level = zap.NewAtomicLevelAt(zap.DebugLevel)
		logger, err = config.Build()
	default: // "info" or any other value will default to production
		// Production logger is optimized for performance. It outputs structured
		// JSON, and logs at Info level and above by default.
		config := zap.NewProductionConfig()
		// We can customize the level if needed, e.g., zap.WarnLevel
		config.Level = zap.NewAtomicLevelAt(zap.InfoLevel)
		logger, err = config.Build()
	}

	if err != nil {
		// If logger creation fails, the application is in an unrecoverable state.
		panic(err)
	}

	return logger
}
```

**Important:** Remember to replace `your_project_path` in the import statement with your actual Go module path (e.g., `github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor`).

#### **Comprehensive Explanation**

1.  **Singleton Pattern (`GetLogger`)**:
    *   This section is identical in structure to our configuration singleton. We use a package-level `loggerInstance` variable and a `sync.Once` variable.
    *   The public `GetLogger()` function ensures that the `newLogger()` initialization logic is executed exactly once, the first time the logger is requested. All subsequent calls immediately return the existing instance. This is efficient and thread-safe.

2.  **Dynamic Configuration (`newLogger`)**:
    *   **Dependency on Config:** The very first thing `newLogger()` does is call `config.GetConfig()`. This demonstrates how our singletons can depend on each other. The logger's behavior is determined by the configuration.
    *   **Environment-Aware Logging:** We use a `switch` statement on the `cfg.App.LogLevel` value. This is a powerful pattern.
        *   If `log_level` is `"debug"` in our YAML file, we use `zap.NewDevelopmentConfig()`. This preset configures Zap for development: it logs in a simple, human-readable text format, adds color to the output, and includes the file and line number where the log was called.
        *   For any other value (including `"info"`), we default to `zap.NewProductionConfig()`. This configures Zap for performance: it logs in a structured **JSON format**, which is ideal for log aggregation systems like Splunk, Datadog, or the ELK stack. It is much faster and only includes essential information.
    *   **Building the Logger:** `config.Build()` constructs the final `*zap.Logger` object based on the chosen configuration.
    *   **Panic on Failure:** Just like with the configuration, if the logger cannot be initialized, the application cannot be properly monitored and is in a non-functional state. We `panic` to halt execution immediately.

#### **How to Use It**

Using the logger is now simple and consistent across the entire application.

```go
// Example usage in another file, e.g., main.go
package main

import (
    "your_project_path/internal/logging" // Use your module path
    "go.uber.org/zap"
)

func main() {
    // Get the singleton logger instance.
    logger := logging.GetLogger()

    // IMPORTANT: Defer a call to Sync to flush any buffered log entries
    // before the application exits.
    defer logger.Sync()

    // Now use the logger.
    logger.Info("Application starting...")

    // Structured logging is a key feature of Zap.
    // It allows you to add key-value pairs for easy searching and filtering.
    userID := "user-12345"
    logger.Info("Processing task for user",
        zap.String("user_id", userID),
        zap.Int("task_id", 567),
    )

    logger.Warn("A recoverable issue occurred.")

    // In development (log_level: "debug"), this will be printed.
    // In production (log_level: "info"), this will be ignored.
    logger.Debug("This is a verbose debug message.")
}
```

**Output in Development (`log_level: "debug"`):**
```
2025-07-15T00:33:31.123+0900    INFO    main/main.go:16    Application starting...
2025-07-15T00:33:31.123+0900    INFO    main/main.go:21    Processing task for user    {"user_id": "user-12345", "task_id": 567}
...
```

**Output in Production (`log_level: "info"`):**
```json
{"level":"info","ts":1752536011.123,"caller":"main/main.go:16","msg":"Application starting..."}
{"level":"info","ts":1752536011.123,"caller":"main/main.go:21","msg":"Processing task for user","user_id":"user-12345","task_id":567}
...
```

We now have a production-grade, configurable logging system ready to be used throughout our batch application.

**Analyzing the Request**

I've started by meticulously dissecting the user's request. My focus is on understanding Part 1, Step 5, which deals with "Creating the Central Dependency Struct (Dependency Injection)." The core constraint is clear: the user requires a precise explanation. I'm aiming to pinpoint the critical elements within this task, ensuring I deliver a clear and effective response. I'm thinking of how I can clarify the concept to provide the required support.


**Addressing the Shift**

I've hit a conceptual snag. The original phrasing, "Creating the Central Dependency Struct," is misleading given the user's chosen design. Now, I'm focusing on clarifying how "creating dependencies" evolves in Approach A. It's about defining the shared elements, not creating a central container. I'll outline *what* needs to be injected and *why*, while acknowledging the change in direction explicitly.


**Clarifying Dependencies**

I'm now zeroing in on defining the shared dependencies within the `internal/app` package, aligning with Approach A. The emphasis is shifting from a central struct to identifying and listing the shared resources. I've compiled a list of dependencies the processors will need, preparing to explain why this approach ensures maintainability and testability in the upcoming code. I'm prioritizing clarity.


**Identifying Shared Elements**

I've streamlined my thinking and rephrased the step. It's now about identifying and clarifying the shared dependencies rather than constructing a container. This is consistent with Approach A and focuses on defining common elements, like configuration and logging, needed across different processors. My approach prioritizes maintaining maintainability and ensuring the processors can be tested independently.


**Revising the Focus**

I've re-examined the core concept to align with Approach A and the user's intent. Instead of building a central dependency struct, the task now centers on outlining the shared elements that will be injected into each processor. I'm focusing on defining the essential dependencies and explaining why this approach, despite seeming less elegant initially, maintains flexibility and avoids tight coupling. I'll highlight the benefits clearly.


**Outlining Shared Resources**

I've shifted my focus to outlining the shared resources that need to be injected into each processor, avoiding the central dependency struct, per the design approach. I'll define common elements such as configuration, a logger, database connection, and AWS clients. The emphasis is on clarifying these shared requirements to ensure maintainability. This shift directly addresses the user's intent.



</details>

Of course. Let's move on to the final step of Part 1.

This step is where our architectural decision to use **Approach A** (placing dependencies directly in each processor struct) really takes shape. Instead of creating a single, central dependency struct, our task is to identify the complete set of shared dependencies that will be injected into our processors.

---

### **Part 1.5: Defining Shared Dependencies for Injection**

In this step, we are not creating a new file or a central struct. Instead, we are conceptually defining the "bag of dependencies" that our application's main function will create and then "inject" into our concrete `ModeAProcessor` and `ModeBProcessor` structs.

This is the "Dependency Injection" pattern in action: the responsibility of creating dependencies is separated from the business logic that uses them. Our `main` function will act as the "injector."

#### **1. Identifying the Required Dependencies**

Based on the application's workflow and the libraries we've chosen, our processors will need access to the following long-lived objects and clients:

*   **Configuration:** To know which mode to run in, which queues to use, database credentials, etc.
    *   **Type:** `*config.Config`
    *   **Source:** Our `config.GetConfig()` singleton.
*   **Logger:** For structured, consistent logging throughout the process.
    *   **Type:** `*zap.Logger`
    *   **Source:** Our `logging.GetLogger()` singleton.
*   **PostgreSQL Client:** To connect to the database and insert records.
    *   **Type:** `*bun.DB`
    *   **Source:** A new initialization function we will create.
*   **AWS S3 Client:** To get the CSV object and upload the resulting image.
    *   **Type:** `*s3.Client` (from `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3`)
    *   **Source:** A new initialization function we will create.
*   **AWS SQS Client:** To receive messages from the queue.
    *   **Type:** `*sqs.Client` (from `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/sqs`)
    *   **Source:** A new initialization function we will create.

#### **2. How These Dependencies Will Live in the Processors**

Since we are not using a central `Application` struct, each of our processor structs will contain fields for every single one of these dependencies.

Here is a **preview** of what the `ModeAProcessor` struct will look like when we define it in Part 2. Notice the duplication of fields that will also exist in `ModeBProcessor`.

```go
// This is a preview of what we will build in internal/processor/mode_a.go

type ModeAProcessor struct {
    // --- Shared Dependencies (Duplicated in ModeBProcessor) ---
    Cfg      *config.Config
    Logger   *zap.Logger
    DB       *bun.DB
    S3Client *s3.Client
    SQSClient *sqs.Client
    // ---------------------------------------------------------

    // Fields specific to Mode A, if any.
    // For example, the specific queue URL for this mode.
    queueURL string
}
```

#### **3. The Role of the `main` Function as the Injector**

The `main` function in `cmd/app/main.go` now has a critical responsibility: it must initialize all these dependencies and pass them to the constructor of the chosen processor.

Here is a skeleton of what the initialization logic in `main.go` will look like. We will fill this out in detail later, but it's important to understand the flow now.

```go
// Skeleton of cmd/app/main.go

package main

import (
    // ... necessary imports for config, logging, aws, bun, etc.
    "github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor/internal/config"
    "github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor/internal/logging"
    "github.com/your-username/go-batch-processor/internal/processor"
)

func main() {
    // 1. Initialize Singleton Dependencies
    appConfig := config.GetConfig()
    logger := logging.GetLogger()
    defer logger.Sync()

    logger.Info("Application starting", zap.String("mode", appConfig.App.Mode))

    // 2. Initialize External Service Clients (we will build these functions later)
    // awsCfg := initializeAWSConfig(appConfig) // Helper to create AWS config
    // s3Client := initializeS3Client(awsCfg)
    // sqsClient := initializeSQSClient(awsCfg)
    // db := initializeDB(appConfig)

    // 3. Dependency Injection: Select and construct the correct processor
    //    by passing all the created dependencies into its constructor.
    var p app.Processor // The interface we will define in Part 2

    if appConfig.App.Mode == "A" {
        p = processor.NewModeAProcessor(
            appConfig, // dependency 1
            logger,    // dependency 2
            // db,        // dependency 3
            // s3Client,  // dependency 4
            // sqsClient, // dependency 5
        )
    } else {
        p = processor.NewModeBProcessor(
            appConfig, // dependency 1
            logger,    // dependency 2
            // db,        // dependency 3
            // s3Client,  // dependency 4
            // sqsClient, // dependency 5
        )
    }

    // 4. Run the application using the chosen processor
    // runApplication(p)
}
```

#### **Summary of Part 1**

We have successfully completed the foundational setup of our application:

1.  **Project Structure:** We created a clean, logical directory layout.
2.  **Dependencies:** We initialized our Go module and downloaded all necessary libraries.
3.  **Configuration Singleton:** We built a thread-safe system to load configuration from a YAML file.
4.  **Logger Singleton:** We built a thread-safe, environment-aware logging system.
5.  **Dependency Definition:** We have clearly identified the set of shared dependencies and established that our `main` function will be responsible for creating them and injecting them into our processor structs.

This solid foundation prepares us perfectly for **Part 2**, where we will design the core abstractions of our application: the `Processor` interface and the concrete `ModeA` and `ModeB` structs that will contain these dependencies.

**Reviewing My Approach**

I've hit a roadblock. User feedback highlights a complete misinterpretation of the task. It seems my approach is directly opposed to the intended outcome. I'm going back to the core instructions, seeking the point where I went astray, to realign with the user's intent. My goal is to prevent repeating this error.


**Reframing My Understanding**

I'm revisiting the user's feedback, trying to pinpoint the contradiction. My initial analysis of "Approach A" seemed correct, focusing on dependency injection into concrete processors. However, the user's "exactly opposite" comment suggests a crucial misstep. I'm carefully re-examining my response for any deviation from the intended approach, particularly regarding the sharing of dependencies and the central structure. The goal is now to discern where my understanding diverged and rectify the course.


**Discerning the Discrepancy**

I'm revisiting the user's feedback, trying to find the disconnect. My prior analysis of "Approach A" seemed valid, demonstrating dependency injection into concrete processors. However, the feedback indicates a direct contrast. I'm scrutinizing my response for any deviations from the intended direction, specifically regarding shared dependencies and central structure. The goal now is to identify where my comprehension faltered and adjust accordingly.

I'm now carefully reviewing my response and the original instructions for any subtle discrepancies or interpretations that may have led to this misinterpretation. I want to ensure my understanding of the problem aligns perfectly with the intended outcome, which includes the use of dependency injection and singletons.


**Pinpointing the Pivot**

I'm now zeroing in on the crux of the miscommunication. I've re-examined the user's feedback, noting the emphasis on "avoiding prop drilling" and housing singletons within a struct. It seems my focus on dependency injection into individual processors led to a misunderstanding. I now believe the user envisioned a shared struct containing the singletons, injected once, and then used by the processors. This is what I have to do.


**Adjusting My Strategy**

I'm now fully immersed in the core issue. The feedback highlights a misinterpretation of the objective. I'm focusing on the user's intent to avoid prop drilling through a shared singleton struct. My approach seems to have overemphasized individual dependency injection rather than a collective approach. I plan to construct a more unified method.


**Adjusting My Understanding**

I see now. The user's feedback makes it clear I misinterpreted the intent. Although I aimed for dependency injection, I missed the crucial goal of avoiding prop drilling through a central struct for singletons. My focus was too granular. I'll propose a solution that explicitly addresses this core requirement to ensure we're aligned.


**Correcting My Course**

I'm now fully immersed in the core issue. I've re-examined the user's feedback, noting the emphasis on "avoiding prop drilling" and housing singletons within a struct. It seems my focus on dependency injection into individual processors led to a misunderstanding. I now believe the user envisioned a shared struct containing the singletons, injected once, and then used by the processors.


**Identifying the Key Insight**

I now understand the miscommunication. I've re-examined the user's feedback, noting the emphasis on "avoiding prop drilling" and housing singletons within a struct. It appears my approach overemphasized dependency injection into individual processors, overlooking a crucial aspect. The goal is to construct a structure to address this key requirement to ensure we're aligned.



</details>

You are absolutely right to call that out. Thank you for the sharp feedback. I apologize for the confusion—I got caught up in the specifics of "Approach A" and created a response that leads to the exact problem you wanted to solve.

Let's reset and address this correctly. My previous explanation for 1.5 was a direct contradiction of your goal.

You stated, very clearly, two key objectives:
1.  You want to **avoid 'Prop Drilling'**, where functions are forced to carry many dependency arguments.
2.  Your solution is to **"have singleton instances within a struct."**

My last response, which suggested passing a long list of arguments (`appConfig`, `logger`, `db`, `s3Client`, etc.) to your processor constructors, is the *definition* of prop drilling at the initialization stage. It completely fails to meet your requirement.

You were right to reject my initial recommendation of a central dependency struct, but my explanation of the alternative was flawed. The correct way to implement your vision is to create that central struct. It is the literal embodiment of your idea: "a struct to hold the singleton instances."

Let's correct the course. This is the approach that actually aligns with your request.

---

### **Part 1.5 (Corrected): Creating the Central Dependency Struct**

The purpose of this step is to create the single, clean container for all our shared dependencies. This struct is the key to avoiding prop drilling. Instead of passing `logger`, `config`, and `db` around individually, we will pass this one struct.

This aligns perfectly with the refined project structure we discussed earlier, where this struct lives in `internal/app/app.go`.

#### **1. Define the `Application` Struct**

We will create a new file, `internal/app/app.go`, to define our dependency container. We'll call the struct `Application` because it represents the entire running application's state and capabilities.

Create the file `internal/app/app.go`:

```go
package app

import (
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/sqs"
	"github.com/uptrace/bun"
	"go.uber.org/zap"
	"your_project_path/internal/config" // Replace with your module path
)

// Application holds all shared, long-lived application dependencies.
// This struct is the implementation of your goal: "to have singleton
// instances within a struct" to avoid prop drilling.
type Application struct {
	Config    *config.Config
	Logger    *zap.Logger
	DB        *bun.DB
	S3Client  *s3.Client
	SQSClient *sqs.Client
}
```
**Important:** Remember to replace `your_project_path` with your actual Go module path.

#### **2. The Role of the `main` Function (Revised)**

With this `Application` struct, the role of our `main` function becomes much cleaner. It will:
1.  Initialize all individual dependencies (logger, config, clients).
2.  Assemble them into a single `*Application` instance.
3.  Inject this **single instance** into our processors.

This completely eliminates the prop drilling problem at the point of injection.

Compare the difference in the `main` function's logic:

**The Incorrect Way (My previous, flawed answer):**
```go
// This is what we want to AVOID
p = processor.NewModeAProcessor(
    appConfig, // arg 1
    logger,    // arg 2
    db,        // arg 3
    s3Client,  // arg 4
    sqsClient, // arg 5
)
```

**The Correct Way (Using the `Application` struct):**
```go
// This is the clean approach that meets your goal.

// 1. Assemble the struct
app := &app.Application{
    Config:    appConfig,
    Logger:    logger,
    DB:        db,
    S3Client:  s3Client,
    SQSClient: sqsClient,
}

// 2. Inject the SINGLE struct
var p app.Processor // The interface we will define next
if app.Config.App.Mode == "A" {
    p = processor.NewModeAProcessor(app) // Only one argument!
} else {
    p = processor.NewModeBProcessor(app) // Only one argument!
}
```

#### **3. How This Affects the Processors**

Now, our processor structs will not contain a long, duplicated list of fields. Instead, they will simply embed the `*Application` struct, giving them access to everything they need in a clean, maintainable way. This is the "composition over inheritance" you wanted.

**Preview of the `ModeAProcessor` (Corrected):**
```go
// This is a preview of what we will build in Part 2

type ModeAProcessor struct {
    *app.Application // Embed the application struct
    // ... any fields specific to Mode A
}

func (p *ModeAProcessor) SomeMethod() {
    // Access dependencies cleanly through the embedded struct
    p.Logger.Info("Logging from the processor")
    p.DB.Query(...)
}
```

Thank you again for your correction. This revised approach, centered on the `Application` dependency struct, is the right path forward and directly implements the clean, maintainable architecture you requested.

Does this revised plan for Part 1.5 now align with your vision? Once you confirm, we can proceed to Part 2.

**Conceptualizing the Strategy**

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's request, focusing on the transition to "Part 2, 2-1: Defining the Core Logic and Its Variations." It's clear this is a crucial conceptual shift, a necessary preamble to the actual coding phase. My focus now is on dissecting the user's needs to ensure a robust and adaptable framework.


**Outlining the Shared Steps**

I've made progress in breaking down the core logic. I'm focusing on identifying the identical steps regardless of the mode. Steps like retrieving the S3 key and object, and CSV parsing, are consistent. I'm building a robust, versatile framework based on the common actions.


**Refining the Framework**

I'm now identifying the shared steps across the processing modes. These steps form the foundation of a flexible structure. My focus has shifted to the nuances of extracting S3 keys, parsing CSV data, sending HTTP requests, and handling image uploads. I'm building a robust core that can accommodate mode-specific variations seamlessly.


**Outlining Shared Actions**

I'm now identifying the shared steps across the various processing modes. Steps like retrieving S3 data and parsing CSV content are consistent. My thinking is leaning towards building a robust base layer to maximize reusability. I'm focusing on the common ground, setting the stage for modular adaptability.


**Formulating a Structure**

I'm now zeroing in on defining the core logic and its variations, which sets the stage for efficient coding. My aim is to clearly illustrate the common and distinct elements of the process. I'm focusing on creating an adaptable structure that highlights the shared actions, thus setting the stage for future modular components.


**Decomposing the Process**

I've been meticulously dissecting the proposed batch process, identifying its fundamental components. Focusing on separating the shared and variable logic is crucial for code reusability. I'm zeroing in on defining the consistent actions and the configurable parameters. This will form the foundation for a modular and adaptable architecture.



</details>

Excellent. We are now moving into the architectural core of the application. Part 2 is all about designing the Go code in a way that is clean, reusable, and easy to extend, using the patterns you've chosen.

Let's begin with the first, crucial step: analyzing and separating the application's logic.

---

### **Part 2.1: Defining the Core Logic and Its Variations**

Before writing any interfaces or structs, a critical design step is to clearly distinguish between what is *common* and what is *different* between your two processing modes. By identifying the shared logic, we can write it once and reuse it. By identifying the variable logic, we know exactly what needs to be configured for each mode.

This separation is the foundation for applying the "composition over inheritance" pattern effectively in Go.

#### **Shared Logic: The Processing "Engine"**

This is the core workflow of the application. These steps are identical regardless of whether we are running in "Mode A" or "Mode B". This shared logic will form the basis of a reusable component.

1.  **SQS Message Parsing:** The structure of the SQS message body is expected to be the same for both modes—a JSON object containing an S3 key. The logic to deserialize this message and extract the key is shared.
    *   *Example Action:* `func (p *Processor) extractS3Key(msg *sqs.Message) (string, error)`

2.  **S3 Object Retrieval:** Given an S3 key, the process of calling the AWS S3 API to download the object's content (the CSV file) is identical.
    *   *Example Action:* `func (p *Processor) getS3Object(ctx context.Context, key string) ([]byte, error)`

3.  **CSV Parsing:** The logic to read the downloaded byte slice, treat it as a CSV, skip the header row, and extract the data from the first record is identical.
    *   *Example Action:* `func (p *Processor) parseCSV(data []byte) (string, error)` (assuming the key for the external API is a string).

4.  **External API Interaction:** The procedure for constructing and sending an HTTP GET request to the external API, including setting headers and handling timeouts, is the same for both modes.
    *   *Example Action:* `func (p *Processor) callExternalAPI(ctx context.Context, key string) (*http.Response, error)`

5.  **JSON Response Handling:** The logic to read the body of a successful HTTP response and parse it into a generic `map[string]interface{}` (since the structure is unknown) is identical.
    *   *Example Action:* `func (p *Processor) parseJSONResponse(resp *http.Response) (map[string]interface{}, error)`

6.  **Image Upload to S3:** The process of taking the image data from the API response and uploading it to the configured S3 bucket is identical. The destination bucket is a shared configuration value (`aws.s3_image_bucket`).
    *   *Example Action:* `func (p *Processor) uploadImageToS3(ctx context.Context, imageName string, data []byte) error`

This entire sequence forms a reusable "engine" that we can build once.

#### **Variable Logic: The Mode-Specific "Configuration"**

These are the specific parameters that define the unique behavior of "Mode A" versus "Mode B". These differences are not in the *logic* itself, but in the *data* the logic uses.

1.  **SQS Source Queue:** This is the most significant difference. Each mode listens to a completely separate SQS queue.
    *   **Mode A:** Uses the URL from `config.AWS.SQSQueueURLModeA`.
    *   **Mode B:** Uses the URL from `config.AWS.SQSQueueURLModeB`.

2.  **PostgreSQL Destination Table:** The CSV data is inserted into a different database table depending on the mode.
    *   **Mode A:** Inserts into a specific table, let's call it `table_a`.
    *   **Mode B:** Inserts into a different table, `table_b`.

#### **Our Architectural Strategy**

Based on this analysis, our plan is as follows:

1.  We will create a **`BaseProcessor`** struct that contains the implementation for all the **Shared Logic**. This struct will have methods for each step of the engine (fetching from S3, calling the API, etc.). It will also embed the `*app.Application` struct to get access to the logger, DB client, and other dependencies.

2.  We will then create two concrete structs, **`ModeAProcessor`** and **`ModeBProcessor`**. These structs will represent the **Variable Logic**. They will hold the specific configuration values (the SQS queue URL and the database table name).

3.  Crucially, `ModeAProcessor` and `ModeBProcessor` will **embed** the `BaseProcessor`. This will give them all the shared "engine" functionality for free, achieving our goal of composition and code reuse.

This approach creates a clear and logical separation. The `BaseProcessor` is the reusable engine, and the concrete processors are lightweight "configurations" that direct the engine's work.

**Analyzing the User's Request**

I'm currently breaking down the user's need. I'm focusing on the request itself: "Part 2.2: Composition over Inheritance in Go." This initial deconstruction helps me pinpoint the core concept and the context - Go. My next step will be to explore the meaning of "composition over inheritance" in the context of Go's design. I'm looking for the essential elements of that approach.


**Exploring Go's Design**

My focus has shifted to the 'why' behind composition in Go. I'm building my explanation around the user's concerns about the Template Method pattern and their preference for composition. I'm drawing connections between "is-a" vs. "has-a" relationships, and how Go leverages struct embedding and interfaces. I'm aiming to provide a clear and concise contrast.


**Contrasting Inheritance and Composition**

My focus has refined the distinction between inheritance and composition. I'm building my response around the user's initial concerns. I'm now presenting them with clear contrasts. I will begin with the "is-a" vs. "has-a" relationship framework, and progress into struct embedding in Go. I'm aiming to provide an easy to follow explanation, highlighting the difference between coupling and loose coupling.


**Synthesizing the Explanation**

I'm now weaving together the "why," the definitions, and the specific application to present a clear picture of composition. I'll showcase struct embedding as Go's way, contrasting it with inheritance. I'm focusing on the "has-a" over "is-a" relationship within our code's design. I'm building a simple illustration of how the application would use this pattern.


**Elaborating Go's Approach**

I'm now focusing on the practical implementation using struct embedding, contrasting it directly with the user's avoided "Template Method." I will present the advantages of "has-a" relationships in Go's context. I'm building a concise code example for the user to better understand composition. My explanation stresses the flexibility and loose coupling it offers.


**Refining the Explanation**

I'm now refining my presentation of struct embedding, specifically to address the 'has-a' vs. 'is-a' distinction. I plan to use the `BaseProcessor` and `ModeAProcessor` example, highlighting how the embedded struct behaves, but is not 'a' direct inheritor. I'll contrast this with how the `Template Method` would have worked. My aim is a concise, but thorough explanation.

Of course. This section is fundamental to understanding *why* we are structuring our code in this particular way. It's about embracing Go's philosophy rather than trying to force patterns from other languages.

### **Part 2.2: The "Composition over Inheritance" Strategy in Go**

The phrase "prefer composition over inheritance" is a well-known software design principle, but Go elevates it from a preference to a core tenet of the language. Go deliberately omits classical inheritance (the `class Dog extends Animal` model) to avoid the problems it can create, such as rigid hierarchies and tight coupling.

Instead, Go provides powerful tools for **composition**, primarily through **struct embedding**. This is the strategy we will use to build our processors.

#### **What is Inheritance? (The "is-a" Relationship)**

In traditional object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship.
*   A `Car` **is-a** `Vehicle`.
*   A `Manager` **is-a** `Employee`.

The subclass (`Car`) automatically gets all the properties and methods of the superclass (`Vehicle`). This can lead to deep, complex hierarchies that are difficult to change. If you need a `Bicycle` that is also a `Vehicle` but doesn't have an `engine`, the model starts to break down. This is the rigidity Go aims to avoid.

The **Template Method pattern** you mentioned is a classic example of inheritance. It defines a "skeleton" algorithm in a base class and lets subclasses override specific steps. This forces a strict "is-a" relationship and is exactly what we want to avoid.

#### **What is Composition? (The "has-a" Relationship)**

Composition creates a "has-a" relationship. Instead of a class *being* something else, it *has* something else.
*   A `Car` **has-a** `Engine`.
*   A `Car` **has-a** `Chassis`.
*   An `Employee` **has-a** `PaycheckCalculator`.

This model is far more flexible. You can construct complex objects by assembling smaller, independent, and reusable components. If you need to change the engine type in your car, you can swap out the `Engine` component without affecting the `Chassis`.

#### **How Go Achieves Composition: Struct Embedding**

Go's primary tool for composition is **struct embedding**. When you embed a struct within another struct, the fields and methods of the embedded struct are "promoted" to the containing struct. This gives you the benefits of code reuse without the rigid coupling of inheritance.

Let's see how this applies directly to our application design.

**Our Components:**
1.  **`app.Application`**: The dependency container. It **has** a logger, a config, a DB connection, etc.
2.  **`BaseProcessor`**: The processing engine. It will contain all the **shared logic** we identified in 2.1 (like `getS3Object`, `callExternalAPI`). It **has** the `app.Application` dependencies.
3.  **`ModeAProcessor`**: The concrete processor for Mode A. It **has** a `BaseProcessor` to do the heavy lifting and **has** the specific configuration data for Mode A (like the table name).

**Visualizing the Code Structure:**

```go
// in internal/app/app.go
type Application struct {
    // ... Logger, Config, DB, etc.
}

// in internal/processor/base.go (we will create this file)
// The "Engine" with shared logic and dependencies.
type BaseProcessor struct {
    *app.Application // Embeds the dependency container
}

// A shared method belonging to the engine.
func (bp *BaseProcessor) GetS3Object(key string) {
    bp.Logger.Info("Getting S3 object", zap.String("key", key))
    // ... logic to get object from S3 using bp.S3Client
}

// in internal/processor/mode_a.go
// The concrete processor for Mode A.
type ModeAProcessor struct {
    *BaseProcessor // It HAS-A BaseProcessor
    tableName      string // It HAS-A specific table name
}
```

**How it Works in Practice:**

When we create an instance of `ModeAProcessor`, we can call methods from the embedded `BaseProcessor` as if they belonged directly to `ModeAProcessor`.

```go
// In our main function...
modeA := &ModeAProcessor{
    BaseProcessor: &BaseProcessor{Application: app},
    tableName:     "table_a",
}

// We can call the embedded method directly!
// This is NOT inheritance. The call is delegated to the
// inner BaseProcessor struct.
modeA.GetS3Object("my-csv-file.csv")
```

This is the essence of "composition over inheritance" in Go. The `ModeAProcessor` is not a special *type* of `BaseProcessor`. It is a distinct struct that **contains** a `BaseProcessor` and uses its functionality. This design is:

*   **Flexible:** We could easily create a `ModeCProcessor` that embeds the same `BaseProcessor` but adds completely different fields and methods.
*   **Clear:** The "has-a" relationship is explicit. It's easy to see that `ModeAProcessor`'s power comes from the components it holds.
*   **Reusable:** The `BaseProcessor` is a self-contained, reusable component that can be embedded anywhere it's needed.
*   **Testable:** We can test the `BaseProcessor` engine in complete isolation from the specific modes.

By following this strategy, we are building our application in a way that is idiomatic to Go, avoiding the pitfalls of classical inheritance and creating a more modular and maintainable system.
