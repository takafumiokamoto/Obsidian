Is it able to output URL to API gateway when CloudFormation stack created?

Yes, AWS CloudFormation absolutely supports outputting the URL (or invoke endpoint) of an API Gateway resource when a stack is created or updated. This is done using the `Outputs` section in your CloudFormation template, which allows you to export useful values like the API Gateway's endpoint URL for easy access after deployment. These outputs can be viewed in the AWS Management Console, via the AWS CLI, or integrated into other tools/scripts.

Let me break this down for you step by step, including an example. If this doesn't fully address what you're asking or if you have more details (e.g., a specific template or error you're encountering), feel free to provide more context!

### How It Works
1. **Define the API Gateway Resource**: In your CloudFormation template (YAML or JSON), you create an `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` (for REST APIs) or `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api` (for HTTP/WebSocket APIs) resource, along with any necessary deployments and stages.

2. **Add an Output**: Use the `Outputs` section to reference the API's endpoint. For example:
   - For REST APIs (ApiGateway v1), the endpoint is typically in the format `https://{restapi-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}`.
   - For HTTP APIs (ApiGateway v2), it's `https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com`.

3. **Access the Output**: After stack creation, you can retrieve outputs using:
   - AWS CLI: `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name YourStackName --query "Stacks[0].Outputs"`
   - AWS Console: Check the "Outputs" tab in the CloudFormation stack details.

### Example CloudFormation Template Snippet (YAML)
Here's a simplified example for a basic HTTP API (ApiGateway v2). I've formatted the code with proper indentation and a print width of 80 characters for readability.

```yaml
Resources:
  MyHttpApi:
    Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api
    Properties:
      Name: MyExampleApi
      ProtocolType: HTTP

  MyApiDeployment:
    Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Deployment
    DependsOn: MyHttpApi
    Properties:
      ApiId: !Ref MyHttpApi

  MyApiStage:
    Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Stage
    Properties:
      ApiId: !Ref MyHttpApi
      DeploymentId: !Ref MyApiDeployment
      StageName: prod

Outputs:
  ApiEndpoint:
    Description: The invoke URL for the API Gateway
    Value: !Sub "https://${MyHttpApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/prod"
    Export:
      Name: MyApiEndpoint  # Optional: Exports for cross-stack references
```

- **Explanation of the Output**:
  - `!Sub` is a CloudFormation intrinsic function to construct the URL string.
  - It combines the API ID (from `!Ref MyHttpApi`), the AWS Region, and the stage name.
  - For a REST API, you'd use something similar but reference `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` and its deployment/stage.

### Things to Keep in Mind
- **Dependencies**: Ensure your API has a deployment and stage configured, as the URL isn't available until those are set up.
- **Custom Domains**: If you're using a custom domain name with API Gateway, you could output that instead (e.g., via `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::DomainName`).
- **Security and Best Practices**: Outputs are great for automation, but avoid exposing sensitive info. Also, consider using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for simpler API Gateway setupsâ€”it builds on CloudFormation and handles outputs nicely.
- **Troubleshooting**: If the output isn't appearing, check for stack errors (e.g., missing permissions or invalid refs). You can always update the stack to add/modify outputs.

Can I retrieve endpoint URL from AWS cli?

Yes, absolutely! You can retrieve the endpoint URL (or any other outputs) from an AWS CloudFormation stack using the AWS CLI. This is straightforward and works whether the URL was defined in the stack's `Outputs` section (as in the example I shared earlier) or if you need to query API Gateway resources directly.

I'll walk you through the options step by step, including exact CLI commands. Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials (e.g., via `aws configure`). If you run into permission issues, ensure your IAM role has `cloudformation:DescribeStacks` and/or `apigateway:GET` permissions.

### 1. **Retrieving from CloudFormation Stack Outputs (Recommended if Using CFN)**
If your API Gateway endpoint is exposed as an output in your CloudFormation template (e.g., named `ApiEndpoint`), you can query the stack directly. This is efficient because it pulls exactly what you've defined.

- **Command**:
  ```
  aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name YourStackName --query "Stacks[0].Outputs"
  ```

- **Example Output** (in JSON format):
  ```
  [
      {
          "OutputKey": "ApiEndpoint",
          "OutputValue": "https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod",
          "Description": "The invoke URL for the API Gateway"
      }
  ]
  ```

- **Tips**:
  - Replace `YourStackName` with your actual stack name.
  - To filter for a specific output (e.g., just the value), use: `--query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='ApiEndpoint'].OutputValue | [0]"`
  - This works for both REST (v1) and HTTP/WebSocket (v2) APIs.
  - If the stack is in a different region, add `--region your-region` (e.g., `--region us-east-1`).

### 2. **Directly Querying API Gateway via AWS CLI (If Not Using CloudFormation Outputs)**
If the endpoint isn't in a CloudFormation output or you're working outside of a stack, you can query API Gateway resources directly.

- **For REST APIs (API Gateway v1)**:
  - List all REST APIs: `aws apigateway get-rest-apis`
  - To get the endpoint for a specific API, you'll need its ID and stage. The endpoint format is `https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}`.
  - Example to get details for a specific API:
    ```
    aws apigateway get-stages --rest-api-id your-api-id
    ```
    Then construct the URL manually from the `deploymentId` and stage info.

- **For HTTP/WebSocket APIs (API Gateway v2)**:
  - List all APIs: `aws apigatewayv2 get-apis`
  - Example output snippet:
    ```
    {
        "Items": [
            {
                "ApiEndpoint": "https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
                "ApiId": "abc123",
                "Name": "MyExampleApi",
                "ProtocolType": "HTTP"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
  - To get a specific API's endpoint: `aws apigatewayv2 get-api --api-id your-api-id --query "ApiEndpoint"`
  - Note: For HTTP APIs, append the stage or path if needed (e.g., `/prod`).

- **Tips**:
  - Add `--region your-region` if querying a specific AWS region.
  - These commands return raw API details, so you might need to combine them (e.g., via scripting) to build the full invoke URL.

### Additional Advice
- **Automation**: You can pipe these commands into tools like `jq` for better parsing (e.g., `aws cloudformation describe-stacks ... | jq '.Stacks[0].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey == "ApiEndpoint") .OutputValue'`).
- **Common Issues**: If no outputs appear, confirm they're defined in your template and the stack creation succeeded. For API Gateway queries, ensure the API has a deployment and stage.
- **Alternatives**: If you're using AWS CDK or SAM, they often provide similar CLI commands or wrappers for outputs.

If this doesn't cover your exact scenario (e.g., you have a specific API type, stack name, or error message), share more details, and I'll refine the guidance. What kind of API are you working withâ€”REST or HTTP? ðŸ˜Š
