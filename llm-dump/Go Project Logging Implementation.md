**Exploring Project Structure**

I've started by examining the user's Go project structure, noting the standard layout with `cmd/`, `internal/`, and `go.mod`. It's a common, idiomatic organization, hinting at established best practices. I'm focusing on how this structure might influence the best logging strategies.


**Refining Logger Implementation**

I've decided to build on the foundation of the idiomatic Go project structure, focusing on a global logger accessible everywhere. Initially, I'm leaning toward explaining the `slog` package, emphasizing structured logging, but also considering the simplicity of `log` for beginners. It's a balance between thoroughness and clarity.


**Formulating the Tutorial Plan**

I've sketched out a detailed plan for the tutorial. I'll begin with the key aspects of the user's project structure. Next, I'll demonstrate the utility of package-level variables and the merits of structured logging, with a focus on `slog`. Finally, a practical guide to configuring and using the logger globally.


**Outlining the Tutorial**

I'm now fully immersed in the tutorial outline. I'll begin by discussing project structure nuances, highlighting the `internal` package and `go.mod`. Then, the focus will shift to `slog` and structured logging. The final section will be a practical guide for users to implement their own global logging solution.


**Designing the Logging Solution**

I'm now fully immersed in developing the logging solution. I'm focusing on creating `internal/logger/logger.go` with an `Init()` function and wrapper methods for clarity. My plan is to start with a concise explanation of `slog`, emphasizing structured logging, and then to showcase its practical implementation in the user's project structure. I'll make sure to note best practices, too.


**Defining the Logger Package**

I'm now fully immersed in developing the logging solution. I'm focusing on creating `internal/logger/logger.go` with an `Init()` function and wrapper methods for clarity. My plan is to start with a concise explanation of `slog`, emphasizing structured logging, and then to showcase its practical implementation in the user's project structure. I'll make sure to note best practices, too.

I've revised the tutorial structure, now leading with an introduction to structured logging using `slog`. Then, the tutorial will show how to configure a global logger within the existing project. I'll include a step-by-step guide on how to integrate this logger into `cmd/hello/main.go`, and aim for a balance of practical demonstration and theory.


**Refining the Tutorial Outline**

I've made progress on the tutorial's flow. I'll start with structured logging via `slog`, then explain how to create and initialize the global logger in the user's project. The tutorial will feature a practical guide to integrate the global logger into their `cmd/hello/main.go` file. The goal is to provide a complete understanding.



</details>

Of course! I can definitely teach you how to implement a global logger for your Go project. The structure you've chosen is excellent and follows modern Go idioms.

We will create a centralized logger in your `internal` package that can be configured once and used anywhere in your application. We'll use Go's modern, built-in structured logging library, `log/slog`, which is the current best practice.

### 1. A Quick Refinement of Your Structure

To avoid confusion with Go's standard `log` package, it's a common practice to name your logging package something more specific, like `logger`. Let's adjust the structure slightly:

```
├── cmd
│   └── hello
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
└── internal
    └── logger  <-- Create a 'logger' directory
        └── logger.go <-- Place the file inside
```

This prevents potential import conflicts and makes the purpose of the package clearer.

### 2. Your `go.mod` File

First, let's make sure your `go.mod` file has a module name. This name is crucial for importing your internal packages. If you don't have one, you can create it by running `go mod init myproject` in your root directory.

Your `go.mod` file should look something like this:

```go
// go.mod

module myproject

go 1.22
```

The module name `myproject` is what we'll use to import the logger.

### 3. Implementing `internal/logger/logger.go`

This file will define our logger. It will have an `Init` function to set it up and several helper functions (`Info`, `Error`, etc.) to make logging easy.

```go
// internal/logger/logger.go

package logger

import (
	"log/slog"
	"os"
)

// logger is an unexported package-level variable.
// This is the actual slog logger instance.
var logger *slog.Logger

// Init initializes the global logger.
// It should be called once from your main function.
func Init() {
	// We configure our logger to write to standard output (the console)
	// and to use the JSON format for log entries.
	handler := slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
		// We can set a minimum log level.
		// For example, slog.LevelDebug will show all logs,
		// while slog.LevelInfo will ignore Debug logs.
		Level: slog.LevelInfo,
	})

	logger = slog.New(handler)
}

// Info logs a message at the info level.
// The 'args' are key-value pairs.
func Info(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Info(msg, args...)
}

// Warn logs a message at the warn level.
func Warn(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Warn(msg, args...)
}

// Error logs a message at the error level.
func Error(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Error(msg, args...)
}

// Debug logs a message at the debug level.
func Debug(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Debug(msg, args...)
}
```

#### Explanation:

1.  **`var logger *slog.Logger`**: We declare a package-level variable to hold our logger instance. It's **unexported** (starts with a lowercase letter) so that other packages cannot modify it directly. They must use the functions we provide.
2.  **`Init()`**: This is the setup function. We create a `slog.NewJSONHandler`, which tells the logger to format output as JSON and write it to `os.Stdout` (the console). We also set a default logging level.
3.  **`Info()`, `Warn()`, `Error()`, `Debug()`**: These are our wrapper functions. They provide a clean, simple API for the rest of our application. Instead of accessing the `slog` instance directly, other parts of your code will just call `logger.Info("message")`. This makes your code cleaner and decouples it from the specific logging library.

### 4. Using the Logger in `cmd/hello/main.go`

Now, let's use our new logger in your main application.

```go
// cmd/hello/main.go

package main

import (
	"errors"
	// Import your internal logger package using the module path
	// from your go.mod file.
	"myproject/internal/logger"
)

func main() {
	// The VERY FIRST thing you should do in main is initialize the logger.
	logger.Init()

	logger.Info("Application starting up", "version", "1.0.1", "user", "admin")

	// Let's simulate some work
	err := doImportantWork("task-123")
	if err != nil {
		// The structured key-value pairs are great for context.
		logger.Error(
			"The important work failed",
			"error", err,
			"task_id", "task-123",
		)
		// When a critical error happens, you might want to exit.
		// os.Exit(1)
		return
	}

	logger.Info("Application finished successfully.")

	// This message will not be printed if the log level in Init() is slog.LevelInfo
	logger.Debug("This is a debug message with extra details.")
}

func doImportantWork(taskID string) error {
	logger.Info("Starting important work", "task_id", taskID)
	// ... imagine some complex logic here ...
	return errors.New("could not connect to the database")
}
```

#### Explanation:

1.  **`import "myproject/internal/logger"`**: We import our logger package. The path is a combination of your module name (`myproject`) and the path to the package (`internal/logger`).
2.  **`logger.Init()`**: We call this function at the very beginning of `main`. This sets up the logger for the entire application's lifecycle.
3.  **`logger.Info(...)`, `logger.Error(...)`**: We can now call our simple logging functions from anywhere in the `main` package. Notice the powerful structured logging format: `logger.Error("message", "key1", value1, "key2", value2)`. This makes your logs much easier to search and filter later.

### 5. Running Your Project

Now, let's put it all together and run it.

1.  **Tidy dependencies**: Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
2.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/hello
    ```

#### Expected Output:

You will see structured JSON output in your console, which is incredibly useful for log analysis tools.

```json
{"time":"2025-07-02T16:24:14.123Z","level":"INFO","msg":"Application starting up","version":"1.0.1","user":"admin"}
{"time":"2025-07-02T16:24:14.123Z","level":"INFO","msg":"Starting important work","task_id":"task-123"}
{"time":"2025-07-02T16:24:14.123Z","level":"ERROR","msg":"The important work failed","error":"could not connect to the database","task_id":"task-123"}
```

You've now successfully implemented a robust, centralized, and globally accessible logger for your project

### User

is it necessary to make logger directory?
if it isn't against best practice, I would like to simple, flat structure

<summary>Reasoning</summary>

**Assessing the Core Question**

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's inquiry, focusing on the core question: whether the `logger` subdirectory is essential within the `internal` directory. My aim is to discern the nuances of their preference for a simple, flat structure and how it relates to best practices. I am starting to form some initial hypotheses about the implications of the current layout.


**Exploring Organizational Trade-offs**

I'm now delving into the rationale behind structuring the 'logger' functionality as a subdirectory. The initial direct answer is clear: the subdirectory isn't strictly necessary, yet it's often seen as a beneficial practice. I'm focusing on the trade-offs. The user's preference for simplicity in their project is valid, and I'm weighing it against the common advantages of organizational clarity and potential conflict avoidance. A deeper dive is ongoing.


**Clarifying the Technical Nuance**

I've moved on to the technical intricacies. Avoiding package name conflicts is paramount, as a file named `internal/log.go` would lead to naming collisions with the standard library's `log` package. The user needs to understand this core reason. I'm preparing to illustrate the alternative file structure and imports, ensuring they can visualize the ramifications of a flat structure. This involves detailed examples to clarify the trade-offs.


**Elaborating on Trade-offs**

I've been thinking about the trade-offs more in depth. I acknowledge the simplicity the user is after, yet I must explain that using subdirectories provides crucial organizational benefits, especially as a project grows. The potential for name collisions necessitates a structured approach, which I'm now crafting examples for. The goal is clarity.


**Refining Package Strategy**

I'm now refining the package strategy for the flat structure. Initially, the plan was a `log.go` file within the `internal` package, leading to naming conflicts. This has been revised. The preferred approach now involves `logger.go` with the package `internal`, for the flat approach. I'm preparing to detail the implications of this decision.


**Finalizing Flat Structure Options**

I've been working through the details of a flat structure, considering several approaches. My focus is on addressing the potential package name conflict caused by a `log.go` file within the `internal` directory. I'm exploring the implications of various package declarations, aiming to provide a clear and effective solution. The challenge now is explaining the nuanced implications of these decisions to the user.


**Evaluating the Best Path Forward**

My thoughts have been revolving around the best solution for the user. I've been working through different flat structure approaches, specifically to address and explain the naming conflict stemming from a `log.go` file within the `internal` directory. I'm focusing on the clarity of the presentation to provide the user a practical resolution.


**Analyzing Flat Structure Implications**

I'm now exploring the implications of using a flat structure, focusing on the naming conflict with the standard library's `log` package. My current analysis highlights the need to rename the logging file to something like `logger.go` to avoid ambiguity and ensure clean imports, while keeping the `internal` package. I'm preparing code examples.



</details>

That's an excellent question. You are right to think about keeping the structure as simple as possible.

No, it is **not strictly necessary** to create a `logger` subdirectory. You can absolutely place `log.go` directly inside the `internal` directory. For a small project, this can work perfectly fine.

However, it's important to understand the trade-offs. The subdirectory is a widely adopted best practice for a few key reasons, but let's look at how to implement the flat structure you prefer first.

### The Flat Structure: `internal/log.go`

Here is how you would implement it without the extra directory.

#### 1. Your Project Structure

```
├── cmd
│   └── hello
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
└── internal
    └── log.go  <-- Placed directly in internal
```

#### 2. The `internal/log.go` File

The key difference here is the `package` name. In Go, all files within the same directory must belong to the same package (excluding test files). Therefore, your `log.go` file will belong to the `internal` package.

```go
// internal/log.go

// All files in this directory share the 'internal' package name.
package internal

import (
	"log/slog"
	"os"
)

// We still use an unexported variable to hold the logger instance.
var logger *slog.Logger

// InitLogger initializes the global logger for the internal package.
// It's good practice to give it a more specific name like InitLogger
// instead of just Init, in case other files in the 'internal' package
// also need an initialization function.
func InitLogger() {
	handler := slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
		Level: slog.LevelInfo,
	})
	logger = slog.New(handler)
}

// Info logs a message at the info level.
func Info(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Info(msg, args...)
}

// Warn logs a message at the warn level.
func Warn(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Warn(msg, args...)
}

// Error logs a message at the error level.
func Error(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Error(msg, args...)
}

// Debug logs a message at the debug level.
func Debug(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Debug(msg, args...)
}
```

#### 3. Using it in `cmd/hello/main.go`

The import path and the function calls will change slightly. You now import the entire `internal` package.

```go
// cmd/hello/main.go

package main

import (
	"errors"
	// Import the 'internal' package directly
	"myproject/internal"
)

func main() {
	// Call the functions using the package name 'internal'
	internal.InitLogger()

	internal.Info("Application starting up", "version", "1.0.1")

	err := doImportantWork("task-456")
	if err != nil {
		internal.Error(
			"The important work failed",
			"error", err,
			"task_id", "task-456",
		)
		return
	}

	internal.Info("Application finished successfully.")
}

func doImportantWork(taskID string) error {
	internal.Info("Starting important work", "task_id", taskID)
	return errors.New("something went wrong")
}
```

This approach works and is simpler to set up initially.

### Why the Subdirectory (`internal/logger`) is Best Practice

Even though the flat structure works, here is why the subdirectory approach is generally recommended as your project grows:

1.  **Clarity of Imports**:
    *   Flat: `import "myproject/internal"`
    *   Subdir: `import "myproject/internal/logger"`
    The subdirectory makes it immediately obvious that you are importing logging functionality.

2.  **Clarity of Function Calls**:
    *   Flat: `internal.Info(...)`
    *   Subdir: `logger.Info(...)`
    The call `logger.Info()` is more descriptive and less ambiguous than `internal.Info()`. The `internal` package could contain anything (config, database logic, etc.), so `internal.Info()` doesn't clearly state its purpose without looking at the import.

3.  **Avoiding Name Conflicts**: Your file is named `log.go`. If you had named the *package* `log`, it would conflict with the standard library's `log` package, forcing you to use named imports (`import mylog "myproject/internal/log"`), which is extra work. The subdirectory approach neatly solves this by creating a distinct `logger` package.

4.  **Scalability**: Imagine you add database logic. In the flat structure, you'd add `database.go` to `internal`, and it would also be part of `package internal`. Your `internal` package would start to become a mix of unrelated concerns. With subdirectories, you can have `internal/logger`, `internal/database`, and `internal/config`, keeping everything neatly organized.

### Conclusion

For your current project, the **flat structure is perfectly acceptable** and not against best practices for a simple application. It achieves your goal of a global logger.

However, as soon as you anticipate adding more shared, internal code (like database connections, configuration, etc.), I would strongly recommend adopting the **subdirectory structure (`internal/logger`)**. It will keep your code cleaner, more organized, and easier for you or others to understand in the long run.

log.go or logger.go ?

**Deciphering File Naming**

I'm now zeroing in on the user's question, specifically the preference between `log.go` and `logger.go`. I recognize this delves into Go conventions, a crucial consideration. My focus is on the nuances of this follow-up query and its relationship to our prior project structure discussion.


**Refining Naming Conventions**

I've been drilling down on the optimal file name, considering the directory structure. In the scenario of `internal/logger/`, `logger.go` seems like the most logical and convention-compliant option, aligning perfectly with the package name. This approach keeps the structure clean and easily understandable. I'm exploring the implications for other naming approaches in a subdirectory situation.


**Clarifying File Choice**

I'm now assessing how naming conventions interact with our identified scenarios. Considering the directory as `internal/logger/`, I believe `logger.go` is the superior option. This aligns seamlessly with Go conventions, ensuring clarity. However, `log.go` isn't completely unsuitable in that context. I will further analyze the significance of the package name and directory relationship.


**Comparing Naming Approaches**

I'm now assessing both scenarios. When considering a `internal/logger/` setup, naming the file as `logger.go` makes perfect sense. This aligns cleanly with Go conventions. However, as I've noted, `log.go` isn't entirely wrong in that same structure, although `logger.go` is more idiomatic. The relationship between the file name and the package name is more important than the name itself.


**Clarifying File Choice**

I am now focusing on the nuances of this question. In considering the `internal/logger/` structure, I find the choice between `log.go` and `logger.go` is straightforward. The more idiomatic Go approach is to name the file `logger.go`, aligning it directly with the package name. This approach keeps the code structure easily understandable and adheres to conventions. I'm noting the import structure here for clarity.


**Revisiting Go Conventions**

I've been further refining my thoughts on this query about file naming. I've been giving consideration to the nuance in the user's question. Specifically, I'm focusing on the relationship between package name and the file name, as well as the overall directory structure. I'm noting the import statements, so I can ensure I'm using the best practice for package names and directory structure.



</details>

Excellent question. This gets to the heart of Go's conventions.

**The short answer:** Use **`logger.go`** and place it inside a `logger` directory.

Here’s the detailed breakdown of why.

In Go, the name of the **package** is far more important than the name of the file. The package name is what you use in your code (`logger.Info(...)`), while the filename is for organization on the filesystem.

Let's compare the two choices based on the structures we discussed.

---

### Scenario 1: Subdirectory (Best Practice)

Structure: `internal/logger/`

*   **Package Name:** The directory name dictates the package name. So, all files inside `internal/logger/` must start with `package logger`.
*   **Filename Choice:**
    *   **`logger.go` (Recommended):** This is the most idiomatic choice. It's a very strong convention in Go to have a file named after the package (`packagename.go`) that contains the core logic for that package. When another developer sees `logger/logger.go`, they immediately know where to look for the main implementation.
    *   **`log.go`:** This would also work (`internal/logger/log.go`). It's not wrong, but it's slightly less conventional than matching the filename to the package name.

**Conclusion:** In this structure, `logger.go` is the clear winner.

---

### Scenario 2: Flat Structure

Structure: `internal/`

*   **Package Name:** All files in this directory must belong to `package internal`.
*   **Filename Choice:** Here, the filename's job is to describe its specific responsibility within the larger `internal` package.
    *   **`log.go` (Acceptable):** This is a good, descriptive name. It clearly indicates that this file contains logging logic.
    *   **`logger.go` (Also Acceptable):** This is also a good, descriptive name.

**Conclusion:** In this structure, both are fine. There isn't a strong convention favoring one over the other.

---

### The Most Important Reason to Prefer `logger`

The biggest reason to name your **package** (and therefore its directory) `logger` instead of `log` is to **avoid a name collision with the standard library's `log` package.**

If you create `internal/log/log.go`, your package will be `package log`.

When you try to use it alongside the standard `slog` library (which is in the `log/slog` package), your code becomes confusing. You would have to use named imports to distinguish between them, like this:

```go
import (
    stdlog "log" // The standard library log
    "myproject/internal/log" // Your package, also named 'log'
)
```

This is awkward and should be avoided.

By naming your package `logger`, you create a unique, clear name that will never conflict with the standard library.

### Final Recommendation

1.  Create a directory: `internal/logger/`
2.  Name the file inside it: `logger.go`
3.  The first line of that file will be: `package logger`

This combination (`internal/logger/logger.go`) is the most clear, idiomatic, and future-proof solution.

### User

I want my logger to be act like python's loguru does.
For example, I want my log looks like this
```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS|<LOGLEVEL>|<message>
```
Is it able to do this?

**Examining the User's Intent**

I'm starting to grasp the essence of the user's need. The core of this challenge appears to be replicating the flexibility and user-friendliness of Python's `loguru` within the Go ecosystem. I'm focusing on the main function of the required logger.


**Developing a Custom Handler**

I'm now fully immersed in the technical aspects. The challenge boils down to implementing a custom `slog.Handler`. Specifically, I'm focusing on the `Handle` method to achieve the desired custom log format. I see that the `slog.Record` struct contains the essential info: Time, Level, and Message. The goal now is to construct the output string precisely.


**Addressing Attribute Formatting**

I've tackled the core format implementation. The code now correctly outputs the timestamp, level, and message in the specified format. However, I've hit a slight snag. The user's requested format doesn't explicitly include attributes. I'm considering whether to introduce an attribute-handling mechanism. I'm weighing up the trade-offs between simplicity and retaining structured data.


**Considering Structured Attributes**

I'm now at the crux of deciding how to handle attributes. The initial focus was the requested concise format, but I realize I have to account for the structured data. I will explore adding attribute formatting to maintain log information. The user might want the option to keep the structured attributes in a secondary logging method.


**Finalizing Attribute Handling**

I'm revisiting the attribute issue. Initially, I will implement the simple version matching the format, as requested. However, to provide a complete solution, I'll demonstrate how to include attributes in an optional manner, with an example of how to iterate over `r.Attrs`. This preserves data and meets the initial need.


**Designing the `LoguruHandler`**

I'm now detailing the implementation, creating the `LoguruHandler` struct to customize the `slog` output.  The design aims for a balance: adhering to the requested format while acknowledging structured attribute trade-offs. I'll include the necessary methods to complete the handler.


**Designing and Building the Logger**

I've completed the initial draft of the `LoguruHandler` struct. It adheres to the requested custom format and integrates with `slog`. To meet the need, it also provides the user with an approach on how to handle attributes. I'm now polishing the code and adding comprehensive comments.


**Designing the Handler Structure**

The design process continues to evolve. I'm building out the struct for the `LoguruHandler`. It will use an `io.Writer` and potentially handler options for flexibility. I'm now structuring the interface implementation and thinking about how to handle the structured data.



</details>

Yes, you absolutely can! This is a fantastic use case for demonstrating the power and flexibility of Go's `log/slog` library.

To achieve the custom format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS|<LOGLEVEL>|<message>`, you can't use the built-in JSON or Text handlers. Instead, you need to create your own custom `slog.Handler`. It's easier than it sounds.

A `slog.Handler` is an interface that tells `slog` how to process and format a log record. We'll create our own struct that satisfies this interface.

Let's modify our recommended structure (`internal/logger/logger.go`) to implement this.

### 1. Create the Custom Handler: `LoguruHandler`

We will add a new struct, `LoguruHandler`, to our `logger.go` file. This struct will be responsible for formatting the log messages exactly as you want.

### 2. Updated `internal/logger/logger.go`

This file will now contain both our custom handler and the familiar initialization and helper functions.

```go
// internal/logger/logger.go

package logger

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log/slog"
	"os"
)

// LoguruHandler is a custom slog.Handler that formats logs in a
// loguru-like style: TIME|LEVEL|MESSAGE
type LoguruHandler struct {
	// We embed slog.HandlerOptions to handle log levels for us.
	slog.HandlerOptions
	// The writer where logs are sent.
	w io.Writer
}

// NewLoguruHandler creates a new LoguruHandler.
func NewLoguruHandler(w io.Writer, opts *slog.HandlerOptions) *LoguruHandler {
	if opts == nil {
		opts = &slog.HandlerOptions{}
	}
	// Set a default level if one isn't provided.
	if opts.Level == nil {
		opts.Level = slog.LevelInfo
	}
	return &LoguruHandler{
		HandlerOptions: *opts,
		w:              w,
	}
}

// Handle is the core method that formats and writes the log record.
func (h *LoguruHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) error {
	// The format for time is Go's reference time: "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 2006 MST"
	timeStr := r.Time.Format("2006-01-02T15:04:05")
	levelStr := r.Level.String()
	msg := r.Message

	// Note: This simple format does not include structured attributes (key-value pairs).
	// We will discuss this trade-off below.

var logger *slog.Logger

// Init initializes the global logger with our custom LoguruHandler.
func Init() {
	// We now use our custom handler instead of NewJSONHandler.
	handler := NewLoguruHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
		Level: slog.LevelInfo,
	})

	logger = slog.New(handler)
}

// Helper functions remain unchanged.
func Info(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Info(msg, args...)
}

func Warn(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Warn(msg, args...)
}

func Error(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Error(msg, args...)
}

func Debug(msg string, args ...any) {
	logger.Debug(msg, args...)
}
```

### 3. Your `main.go` (No Changes Needed!)

This is the beautiful part. Because we abstracted the logger implementation, your application code **does not need to change at all**. It continues to use the simple `logger.Info(...)` API.

```go
// cmd/hello/main.go

package main

import (
	"errors"
	"myproject/internal/logger"
)

func main() {
	// The VERY FIRST thing you should do in main is initialize the logger.
	logger.Init()

	// The key-value pairs ("version", "1.0.1") will be ignored by our
	// simple handler's format, but the code is still valid.
	logger.Info("Application starting up", "version", "1.0.1", "user", "admin")

	err := doImportantWork("task-123")
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error(
			"The important work failed",
			"error", err,
			"task_id", "task-123",
		)
		return
	}

	logger.Info("Application finished successfully.")
}

func doImportantWork(taskID string) error {
	logger.Info("Starting important work", "task_id", taskID)
	return errors.New("could not connect to the database")
}
```

### 4. Run and See the Output

Run your application from the root directory:

```bash
go run ./cmd/hello
```

**Expected Output:**

You will now see the exact format you wanted!

```
2025-07-02T16:35:06|INFO|Application starting up
2025-07-02T16:35:06|INFO|Starting important work
2025-07-02T16:35:06|ERROR|The important work failed
```

### Key Trade-off: Losing Structured Attributes

It's very important to understand what you gain and lose with this approach.

*   **You Gain:** A clean, human-readable format that you personally prefer.
*   **You Lose:** The primary benefit of `slog`—**structured data**.

In our `main.go`, we logged extra context: `logger.Info("...", "version", "1.0.1")`. Our custom handler **throws this data away** because the format `TIME|LEVEL|MESSAGE` has no place for it.

When you use a structured format like JSON, your logs look like this:
`{"time": "...", "level": "ERROR", "msg": "...", "error": "could not connect", "task_id": "task-123"}`

This is incredibly powerful for automated tools. You can easily filter all logs where `task_id` is `task-123` or where `error` is not null. With your custom text format, you have to rely on simple text searching, which is far less reliable.

If you wanted to include them, you would need to modify the `Handle` method to iterate over the attributes and append them to the string, which would make your format more complex.

### User

Can I use this logger globally in entire project?

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

<details>
<summary>Reasoning</summary>

**Considering Global Scope**

I'm presently dissecting the core question. The user's essentially seeking confirmation on project-wide logger integration. I'm focusing on the implied assumptions and the necessary nuances for a robust answer. The goal is to provide a clear, practical yes/no response with detailed supporting explanations.


**Exploring Package Integration**

I've moved past the initial direct answer and am now structuring the explanation. The focus is on *how* the logger achieves project-wide access. I'm leveraging Go's package import mechanism as the key enabler, and emphasizing the single instance managed internally within the logger package. A clear example using a hypothetical `pkg` directory is in the planning stage to solidify the concept.


**Refining Example Structure**

The example structure's now a bit more clear in my mind. The `pkg/greeter` package's `SayHello` method will demonstrate the ease of logger integration across packages. The key is showing that `greeter` *doesn't* require any special configuration. It simply imports and uses the logger, a perfect illustration of global accessibility.


**Clarifying the Single Instance**

I'm now zeroing in on the crucial concept of the single, global logger instance. It's becoming evident that clearly explaining *how* it's managed internally within the `logger` package is key. I'm building this explanation around the hidden `var logger *slog.Logger` and its initialization within the package.


**Confirming Project-Wide Access**

I'm now fully immersed in constructing the concluding explanation. The goal is to articulate the flow precisely: how initialization happens once in `main`, and then all other packages access the single instance. The focus is on a clear and comprehensive response that covers the underlying principles and avoids common pitfalls, solidifying the global accessibility of the logger.


**Solidifying the Conclusion**

I'm presently building the explanation to solidify the concept. The focus is on the `logger.Init()` function's crucial role in initializing the *global* logger instance within the `main` package.  Then, emphasizing that all other packages simply import and use it. I'm building a simple phrase, "Initialize Once, Use Everywhere," to reinforce the best practice.


</details>

Absolutely. **That is the entire point and primary benefit of this design.**

The logger you've built is designed to be a global, project-wide singleton. You initialize it **once** in your application's entry point (`main.go`), and then you can use it from **any other package** in your project without any further setup.

Let's demonstrate this by adding another package to your project to prove it works.

### 1. An Expanded Project Structure

Imagine you add a `pkg` directory for some reusable business logic. We'll create a `greeter` package inside it.

```
├── cmd
│   └── hello
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── internal
│   └── logger
│       └── logger.go
└── pkg             <-- New directory for reusable packages
    └── greeter     <-- New package
        └── greeter.go
```

### 2. Create `pkg/greeter/greeter.go`

This new package will also use our global logger.

```go
// pkg/greeter/greeter.go

package greeter

import (
	// We import the exact same logger package
	"myproject/internal/logger"
)

// SayHello prepares a greeting and logs its action.
func SayHello(name string) string {
	// We can use the logger here, just like we did in main.go.
	// It doesn't need to be initialized again.
	logger.Info("Preparing greeting", "recipient", name)

	if name == "" {
		logger.Warn("Guest user detected; name is empty")
		name = "Guest"
	}

	return "Hello, " + name
}
```

### 3. Update `cmd/hello/main.go` to Use the `greeter`

Now, we'll modify `main.go` to call our new `greeter` package.

```go
// cmd/hello/main.go

package main

import (
	"myproject/internal/logger"
	"myproject/pkg/greeter" // <-- Import the new greeter package
)

func main() {
	// 1. The logger is initialized ONCE for the entire application.
	logger.Init()

	logger.Info("Application starting up")

	// 2. We call a function from a completely different package.
	message := greeter.SayHello("Alice")
	logger.Info(message) // Log the result

	// 3. Call it again to demonstrate another log entry from the greeter.
	guestMessage := greeter.SayHello("")
	logger.Info(guestMessage)

	logger.Info("Application finished successfully.")
}
```

### How It Works: The Flow

1.  **Initialization:** Your program starts. The very first thing `main()` does is call `logger.Init()`. This creates the single, shared logger instance and stores it in the unexported `logger` variable inside the `logger` package.
2.  **Usage:**
    *   When `main.go` calls `logger.Info(...)`, it's using that shared instance.
    *   When `main.go` calls `greeter.SayHello(...)`, the code execution moves to the `greeter` package.
    *   When `greeter.go` calls `logger.Info(...)` or `logger.Warn(...)`, it is accessing the **exact same shared instance** that was created back in step 1.

### The Golden Rule

> **Initialize Once, Use Everywhere.**

The `logger.Init()` function should **only** be called from the `main` function of your executable program. No other package should ever call it. This ensures that your application has a single, consistent logging configuration for its entire lifecycle.

Because Go's `log/slog` is designed to be safe for concurrent use, you can freely call `logger.Info`, `logger.Error`, etc., from any number of goroutines without worrying about race conditions.
